<h3 class='c011'>CICERO’S LETTERS</h3>

<p class='c012'>No history is more readily studied now-a-days than that
of the last years of the Roman Republic. Learned works
have recently been published upon this subject in France,
England, and Germany,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and the public has read them
with avidity. The importance of the subjects which were
then debated, the dramatic character of the events, and the
grandeur of the characters warrant this interest; but the
attraction we feel for this singular epoch is better explained
by the fact that it is narrated for us in Cicero’s letters.</p>

<p class='c014'>A contemporary said that he who read these letters
would not be tempted to seek the history of that time<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
elsewhere, and in fact we find it much more living and
true in them than in regular works composed expressly to
teach it to us. What more would Asinius Pollio, Livy, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Cremutius Cordus teach us if we had them preserved?
They would give us their personal opinion; but this
opinion is for the most part open to suspicion because it
comes from persons who could not tell the whole truth,
from men like Livy, who wrote at the court of the emperors,
or who hoped, like Pollio, to get their treason pardoned, by
blackening the character of those whom they had betrayed.
Instead of receiving a ready-made opinion it is better to
make one for ourselves, and the perusal of Cicero’s letters
enables us to do this. It throws us into the midst of the
events, and lets us follow them day by day. We seem
to see them pass before our eyes, notwithstanding the
eighteen centuries that intervene, and we find ourselves in
the unique position of being sufficiently near the facts to
see their real character, and sufficiently distant to judge
them dispassionately.</p>

<p class='c014'>The importance of these letters is easily explained. The
politicians of those times had more need of correspondence
with each other than those of the present day. The proconsul
starting from Rome to govern some distant province
felt that he was withdrawing altogether from political life.
To pass several years in those out-of-the-way countries which
the public rumour of Rome did not reach, was very irksome
to men accustomed to the stir of business, the agitations of
parties, or, as they said, the broad daylight of the Forum.
They did indeed receive a sort of official gazette, the
<cite><span lang="la">Acta diurna</span></cite>, the venerable ancestor of our <cite><span lang="fr">Moniteur</span></cite>. But
it appears as though every official journal is condemned by
its nature to be somewhat insignificant. The Roman journal
contained a rather tame official report of public meetings,
a short summary of important cases tried in the Forum,
besides an account of public ceremonies and accurate
notice of atmospheric phenomena or prodigies occurring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>in Rome or its neighbourhood. This is not precisely the
sort of news that a praetor or proconsul wished to know,
and therefore, in order to fill up the gaps in the official
journal, he had recourse to paid correspondents, who made
“news-letters” for the use of inquisitive provincials, as was
the fashion among ourselves in the last century; but
while, in the eighteenth century, literary men of reputation,
intimate with the nobles and well received by ministers,
undertook this duty, the Roman correspondents were only
obscure compilers, workmen as Caelius calls them, usually
chosen among those hungry Greeks whom want made
ready for anything. They had no admittance into the
great houses, nor could they approach the politicians.
Their part simply consisted in running over the town and
picking up what they heard or saw in the streets. They
carefully noted theatrical chit-chat, inquired about actors
who had been hissed and gladiators who had been beaten,
described minutely handsome funerals, noted the rumours
and ill-natured gossip, and especially the scandalous tales they
could catch.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> All this chatter amused for a moment, but
did not satisfy those political personages who wished above
all to be kept abreast of affairs, and, in order to become
acquainted with them, they naturally applied to some one
who was in a position to know them. They chose a few
trustworthy and well-informed friends of good position, and
through them learnt the reason and the real character of the
facts reported dryly and without comment by the journals;
and while their paid correspondents gave them only the
talk of the town, the others introduced them into the
cabinets of the high politicians, and made them listen to
their most private conversations.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>No one felt this need of being kept informed of everything,
and, so to say, of living in the midst of Rome after
he had left it, more than Cicero. No one liked that excitement
of public life which statesmen complain of when they
possess it, and never cease to regret when they have lost it,
more than he. We must not believe him too readily when
he says that he is tired of the stormy discussions of the
senate; that he seeks a country where they have not heard
of Vatinius or Caesar, and where they do not trouble themselves
about agrarian laws; that he has an anxious craving
to go and forget Rome under the agreeable shades of
Arpinum, or in the delightful neighbourhood of Formiae. As
soon as he is settled down at Formiae or Arpinum, or in
some other of those handsome villas which he proudly calls
the gems of Italy, <i><span lang="la">ocellos Italiae</span></i>, his thoughts naturally return
to Rome, and couriers are constantly starting to go and
learn what people are thinking and doing there. He could
never take his eyes off the Forum, whatever he may say.
Far or near he must have what Saint-Simon calls “that
smack of business that politicians cannot do without.”
He wished by all means to know the position of parties,
their secret agreements, their internal discords, all those
hidden intrigues that lead up to events and explain them.
This is what he was continually demanding of Atticus,
Curio, Caelius, and so many other great men mixed up
in these intrigues either as actors or spectators, and what he
himself narrates to his absent friends in the most lively
manner, and thus the letters that he received or sent contain,
without his intending it, all the history of his time.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>The correspondence of political men of our time, when it
is published, is far from having the same importance, because
the exchange of sentiment and thought is not made so much
by means of letters now as it was then. We have invented
new methods. The immense publicity of the press has
advantageously replaced those cautious communications
which could not reach beyond a few persons. Now-a-days
the newspapers keep a man informed of what is doing in
the world, whatever unfrequented place he may have retired
to. As he learns events almost as soon as they happen, he
receives the excitement as well as the news of them, and has
no need of a well-informed friend to apprise him of them.
To seek for all that the newspapers have destroyed and
replaced among us would be an interesting study. In
Cicero’s time letters often took their place and rendered the
same services. They were passed from hand to hand when
they contained news men had an interest in knowing; and
those of important persons which made known their sentiments
were read, commented on, and copied. A politician,
who was attacked, defended himself by them before people
whose esteem he desired to preserve, and through them
men tried to form a sort of public opinion in a limited
public when the Forum was silent, as in Caesar’s time. The
newspapers have taken up this duty now and make a
business of politics, and as they are incomparably more
convenient, rapid, and diffused, they have taken from correspondence
one of its principal subjects.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is true that private affairs remain for it, and we are
tempted to think at first that this subject is inexhaustible,
and that with the sentiments and affections of so many
kinds that fill our home life it would always be rich enough.
Nevertheless, I think that private correspondence becomes
every day shorter and less interesting, where it is only a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>question of feeling and affection. That constant and agreeable
intercourse which filled so large a place in the life of
former times, tends almost to disappear, and one would say
that by a strange chance the facility and rapidity of intercourse,
which ought to give it more animation, have been
injurious to it. Formerly, when there was no post, or when
it was reserved for the emperor’s use, as with the Romans,
men were obliged to take advantage of any opportunity that
occurred, or to send their letters by a slave. Then writing
was a serious affair. They did not want the messenger to
make a useless journey; letters were made longer and more
complete to avoid the necessity of beginning again too
often; unconsciously they were more carefully finished, by
the thought we naturally give to things that cost trouble
and are not very easy. Even in the time of Madame de
Sévigné, when the mails started only once or twice a week,
writing was still a serious business to which every care was
given. The mother, far from her daughter, had no sooner
sent off her letter than she was thinking of the one she
would send a few days later. Thoughts, memories, regrets
gathered in her mind during this interval, and when she
took up her pen “she could no longer govern this torrent.”
Now, when we know that we can write when we will, we do
not collect material as Madame de Sévigné did, we do not
write a little every day, we no longer seek to “empty our
budget,” or torment ourselves in order to forget nothing, lest
forgetfulness should make the news stale by coming too late.
While the periodical return of the post formerly brought
more order and regularity into correspondence, the facility
we have now for writing when we will causes us to write less
often. We wait to have something to say, which is seldomer
than one thinks. We write no more than is necessary; and
this is very little for a correspondence whose chief pleasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>lies in the superfluous, and we are threatened with a reduction
of that little. Soon, no doubt, the telegraph will have
replaced the post; we shall only communicate by this breathless
instrument, the image of a matter-of-fact and hurried
society, which, even in the style it employs, tries to use a
little less than what is necessary. With this new progress
the pleasure of private correspondence, already much impaired,
will have disappeared for ever.</p>

<p class='c014'>But when people had more opportunities for writing
letters, and wrote them better, all did not succeed equally.
Some dispositions are fitter for this work than others.
People whose minds move slowly, and who have need of
much reflection before writing, make memoirs and not
letters. The sober-minded write in a regular and methodical
manner, but they lack grace and warmth. Logicians and
reasoners have the habit of following up their thoughts too
closely; now, one ought to know how to pass lightly from
one subject to another, in order that the interest may be
sustained, and to leave them all before they are exhausted.
Those who are solely occupied with one idea, who concentrate
themselves on it, and will not leave it, are only eloquent
when they speak of it, which is not enough. To be always
agreeable, and on all subjects, as a regular correspondence
demands, one must have a lively and active imagination
which receives the impressions of the moment and changes
abruptly with them. This is the first quality of good letter
writers; I will add to it, if you like, a little artifice.
Writing always requires a certain effort. To succeed in
writing we must aim at success, and the disposition to please
must precede the wish to do so. It is natural enough to
wish to please that great public for whom books are written,
but it is the mark of a more exacting vanity to exert one’s
powers for a single person. It has often been asked since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>La Bruyère, why women succeed better than men in this
kind of writing? Is it not because they have a greater desire
to please and a natural vanity which is, so to say, always
under arms, which neglects no conquest, and feels the need
of making efforts to please everybody?</p>

<p class='c014'>I think nobody ever possessed these qualities in the same
degree as Cicero. That insatiable vanity, that openness to
impressions, that easiness in letting himself be seized and
mastered by events, are found in his whole life and in all
his works. It seems, at first sight, that there is a great
difference between his letters and his speeches, and we are
tempted to ask ourselves how the same man has been able
to succeed in styles so opposed; but astonishment ceases as
soon as we look a little closer. When we seek the really
original qualities of his speeches they are found to be altogether
the same that charm us in his letters. His commonplaces
have got rather old, his pathos leaves us cold, and
we often find that there is too much artifice in his rhetoric,
but his narrations and portraits remain living in his speeches.
It would be difficult to find a greater talent than his for
narrative and description, and for representing to the life
as he does both events and men. If he shows them to
us so clearly, it is because he has them himself before his
eyes. When he shows us the trader Cherea “with his eyebrows
shaved, and that head which smells of tricks, and in
which malignity breathes,”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> or the praetor Verres taking an
airing in a litter with eight bearers, like a king of Bithynia,
softly lying on Malta roses,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> or Vatinius rushing forth to
speak, “his eyes starting, his neck swollen, his muscles
stretched,”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> or the Gallic witnesses, who walk about the
Forum with an air of triumph and head erect,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> or the Greek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>witnesses who chatter without ceasing and gesticulate with
the shoulders,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> all those characters, in fine, that when once
they have been met with in his works are never forgotten,
his powerful and mobile imagination sees them before painting
them. He possesses in a wonderful degree the faculty
of making himself the spectator of what he narrates. Things
strike him, persons attract or repel him with an incredible
vivacity, and he throws himself entirely into the pictures he
makes of them. What passion there is in his narratives!
What furious bursts of anger in his attacks! What frenzy of
joy when he describes some ill fortune of his enemies!
How one feels that he is penetrated and overwhelmed with
it, that he enjoys it, that he delights in it and gloats over it,
according to his energetic expressions: <i><span lang="la">his ego rebus pascor,
his delector, his perfruor!</span></i><a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Saint-Simon, intoxicated with
hatred and joy, expresses himself almost in the same terms
in the famous scene of the “bed of justice,” when he sees
the Duke of Maine struck down and the bastards discrowned.
“I, however,” says he, “was dying with joy, I was even fearing
a swoon. My heart, swelled to excess, found no room
to expand.... I triumphed, I avenged myself, I swam in
my vengeance.” Saint-Simon earnestly desired power, and
twice he thought he held it; “but the waters, as with Tantalus,
retired from his lips every time he thought to touch
them.” I do not think, however, that we ought to pity
him. He would have ill filled the place of Colbert and
Louvois, and even his good qualities perhaps would have
been hurtful to him. Passionate and irritable, he feels
warmly the slightest injury, and flies into a passion at
every turn. The smallest incidents excite him, and we
feel that when he relates them he does so with all his heart.
This ardent sensitiveness which warms all his narratives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>has made him an incomparable painter, but as it would
always have confused his judgment it would have made him
an indifferent politician. Cicero’s example shows this well.</p>

<p class='c014'>We are right then in saying that we find the same qualities
in Cicero’s speeches as in his letters, but they are more
evident in his letters, because he is freer and gives more
play to his feelings. When he writes to any of his friends,
he does not reflect so long as when he is to address the
people; he gives his first impressions, and gives them with
life and passion as they rise in him. He does not take the
trouble to polish his style; all that he writes has usually such
a graceful air, something so easy and simple that we cannot
suspect preparation or artifice. A correspondent who wished
to please him, having spoken to him one day of the thunders
of his utterance, <i><span lang="la">fulmina verborum</span></i>, he answered: “What do
you think then of my letters? Do you not think that I
write to you in the ordinary style? One must not always
keep the same tone. A letter cannot resemble a pleading
or a political speech&#160;... one uses every-day expressions in
it.”<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Even if he had wished to give more care to them he
could not have found leisure. He had so many to write to
content everybody! Atticus alone sometimes received three
in the same day. So he wrote them where he could—during
the sitting of the senate, in his garden, when he is out
walking, on the high-road when he is travelling. Sometimes
he dates them from his dining-room, where he dictates them
to his secretaries between two courses. When he writes
them with his own hand he does not give himself time to
reflect any the more. “I take the first pen I find,” he tells
his brother, “and use it as if it were good.”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Thus it was
not always easy to decipher him. When any one complains
he does not lack excuses. It is the fault of his friends’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>messengers, who will not wait. “They come all ready to
start, with their travelling caps on, saying that their companions
are waiting for them at the door.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Not to keep
them waiting, he must write at random all that comes into
his mind.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us thank these impatient friends, these hurried messengers
who did not give Cicero time to make eloquent
essays. His letters please us precisely because they contain
the first flow of his emotions, because they are full of
graceful negligence and naturalness. As he does not take
time to disguise himself we see him as he is. His brother
said to him one day, “I saw your own self in your letter.”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
We are inclined to say the same thing ourselves every time
we read him. If he is so lively, earnest, and animated when
he addresses his friends, it is because he so easily transports
himself in imagination to the places where they are. “I
feel as though I were talking to you,”<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> he writes to one of
them. “I don’t know how it happens,” he says to another,
“that I think I am near you while writing to you.”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> He gives
way to his passing emotions in his letters even more than in
his speeches. When he arrives at one of his fine country
houses that he likes so much, he gives himself up to the
pleasure of seeing it again; it has never seemed to him so
fine. He visits his porticoes, his gymnasia, his garden seats;
he runs to his books, ashamed of having left them. Love
of solitude seizes him so strongly that he never finds himself
sufficiently alone. He ends by disliking his house at Formiae
because there are so many intruders. “It is not a villa,”
he says, “it is a public lounge.”<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> There he finds again the
greatest bores in the world, his friend Sebosus and his friend
Arrius, who persists in not returning to Rome, however much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>he may entreat him, in order to keep him company and
philosophize with him all day long. “While I am writing
to you,” he says to Atticus, “Sebosus is announced. I have
not finished lamenting this when I hear Arrius saluting me.
Is this leaving Rome? What is the use of flying from others
to fall into the hands of these?” I wish, he adds, quoting
a fine verse very likely borrowed from his own works, “I
wish to fly to the mountains of my birthplace, the cradle of
my infancy. <i><span lang="la">In montes patrios et ad incunabula nostra.</span></i>”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
He goes in fact to Arpinum; he extends his journey to
Antium, the wild Antium, where he passes the time counting
the waves. This obscure tranquillity pleases him so much
that he regrets he was not duumvir in this little town rather
than consul at Rome. He has no higher ambition than to
be rejoined by his friend Atticus, to walk with him in the
sun, or to talk philosophy “seated on the little bench
beneath the statue of Aristotle.” At this moment he seems
disgusted with public life, he will not hear speak of it. “I
am resolved to think no more about it,”<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> he says. But we
know how he kept this sort of promise. As soon as he is
back in Rome he plunges into the thick of politics; the
country and its pleasures are forgotten. We only detect
from time to time a few passing regrets for a calmer life.
“When shall we live then?” <i><span lang="la">quando vivemus?</span></i> says he sadly
in this whirlwind of business that hurries him on.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> But
these timorous complaints are soon stifled by the noise and
movement of the combat. He enters and takes part in it
with more ardour than anybody. He is still excited by it
when he writes to Atticus, its agitation is shown by his letters
which communicate it to us. We imagine ourselves looking
on at those incredible scenes that take place in the senate
when he attacks Clodius, sometimes by set speeches, sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>by impetuous questions, employing against him by
turns the heaviest arms of rhetoric and the lightest shafts of
raillery. He is still more sprightly when he describes the
popular assemblies and recounts the scandals of the elections.
“Follow me to the Campus Martius, corruption is rampant,
<i><span lang="la">sequere me in Campum; ardet ambitus</span></i>.”<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> And he shows us
the candidates at work, purse in hand, or the judges in the
Forum shamelessly selling themselves to whoever will pay
them, <i><span lang="la">judices quos fames magis quam fama commovit</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>As he has the habit of giving way to his impressions and
changing with them, his tone varies from letter to letter.
Nothing is more desponding than those he writes in exile;
they are a continual moan; but his sentences suddenly
become majestic and triumphant immediately after his return
from exile. They are full of those flattering superlatives that
he distributes so liberally to those who have served him, <i><span lang="la">fortissimus</span></i>,
<i><span lang="la">prudentissimus</span></i>, <em>exoptatissimus</em>, etc., he extols in
magnificent terms the marks of esteem given him by people
of position, the authority he enjoys in the Curia, the credit he
has so gloriously reconquered in the Forum, <i><span lang="la">splendorem
ilium forensem, et in senatu auctoritatem et apud viros bonos
gratiam</span></i>.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Although he is only addressing his faithful
Atticus, we think we hear an echo of the set orations he has
just pronounced in the senate and before the people. It
sometimes happens that on the gravest occasions he smiles
and jokes with a friend who amuses him. In the thick of
his conflict with Antony he writes that charming letter to
Papirius Poetus, in which he advises him in such a diverting
manner to frequent again the good tables, and to give good
dinners to his friends.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> He does not defy dangers, he
forgets them; but let him meet some timorous person, he
soon partakes his fear, his tone changes at once; he becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>animated, heated; sadness, fear, emotion carry him without
effort to the highest flights of eloquence. When Caesar
threatens Rome, and insolently places his final conditions
before the senate, Cicero’s courage rises, and he uses, when
writing to a single person, those energetic figures of speech
which would not be out of place in a public oration. “What
a fate is ours! Must we then give way to his impudent
demands! for so Pompey calls them. In fact has a more
shameless audacity ever been seen?—You have occupied
for ten years a province that the senate has not given you,
but which you have seized yourself by intrigue and violence.
The term has arrived which your caprice alone and not the
law has fixed for your power.—But let us suppose it was the
law—the term having arrived, we name your successor, but
you resist and say, ‘Respect my rights.’ And you, what do
you do to ours? What pretext have you for keeping your
army beyond the term fixed by the people, in spite of the
senate?—You must give way to me or fight.—Well then!
let us fight, answers Pompey, at least we have the chance of
conquering or of dying free men.”<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>If I wished to find another example of this agreeable
variety and these rapid changes, I should not turn to Pliny
or to those who, like him, wrote their letters for the public,
I should come down to Madame de Sévigné. She, like
Cicero, has a very lively and versatile imagination; she
gives way to her first emotions without reflection; she is
caught by things present, and the pleasure she is enjoying
always seems the highest. It has been remarked that she
took pleasure everywhere, not through that indolence of
mind that attaches us to the place where we are, to avoid
the trouble of changing, but by the vivacity of her character
which gave her up entirely to the pleasures of the moment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Paris does not charm her so much as to prevent her liking
the country, and no one of that age has spoken about
nature better than this woman of fashion who was so
much at ease in drawing-rooms, and seemed made for
them. She escapes to Livry the first fine day to enjoy
“the triumph of May,” to “the nightingale, the cuckoo, and
the warbler that begin the spring in the woods.” But Livry
is still too fashionable, she must have a more complete
solitude, and she cheerfully retires under her great trees in
Brittany. This time her Paris friends think she will be
wearied to death, having no news to repeat or fine wits to
converse with. But she has taken some serious moral
treatise by Nicole with her; she has found among those
neglected books whose last refuge, like that of old furniture,
is the country, some romance of her young days which
she reads again secretly, and in which she is astonished
still to find pleasure. She chats with her tenants, and just
as Cicero preferred the society of the country people to that
of the provincial fashionables, she likes better to talk with
her gardener Pilois than with “several who have preserved
the title of esquire in the parliament of Rennes.” She
walks in her Mall, in those solitary alleys where the trees
covered with fine-sounding mottoes almost seem as though
they were speaking to each other; she finds, in fact, so
much pleasure in her desert that she cannot make up her
mind to leave it; nevertheless no woman likes Paris better.
Once back there she surrenders herself wholly to the
pleasures of fashionable life. Her letters are full of it.
She takes impressions so readily that we might almost tell
in perusing them what books she has just been reading,
at what conversations she has been present, what drawing-rooms
she has just left. When she repeats so pleasantly to
her daughter the gossip of the court we perceive that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>has just been conversing with the graceful and witty
Madame de Coulanges, who has repeated it to her. When
she speaks so touchingly of Turenne she has just left the
Hôtel de Bouillon, where the prince’s family are lamenting
his broken fortunes as well as his death. She lectures, she
sermonizes herself with Nicole, but not for long. Let her
son come in and tell her some of those gay adventures of
which he has been the hero or the victim, she recounts
boldly the most risky tales on condition of saying a little
later, “Pardon us, Monsieur Nicole!” When she has been
visiting La Rochefoucauld everything turns to morality;
she draws lessons from everything, everywhere she sees
some image of life and of the human heart, even in the
viper broth that they are going to give Madame de la
Fayette who is ill. Is not this viper, which though opened
and skinned still writhes, like our old passions? “What
do we not do to them? We treat them with insult,
harshness, cruelty, disdain; we wrangle, lament, and storm,
and yet they move. We cannot overcome them. We
think, when we have plucked out their heart, that they are
done with and we shall hear no more of them. But no;
they are always alive, they are always moving.” This ease
with which she receives impressions, and which causes her
to adopt so quickly the sentiments of the people she visits,
makes her also feel the shock of the great events she looks
on at. The style of her letters rises when she narrates them,
and, like Cicero, she becomes eloquent unconsciously.
Whatever admiration the greatness of the thoughts and the
liveliness of expression in that fine piece of Cicero upon
Caesar that I quoted just now may cause me, I am still
more touched, I admit, by the letter of Madame de
Sévigné on the death of Louvois, and I find more boldness
and brilliancy in that terrible dialogue which she imagines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>between the minister who demands pardon and God who
refuses it.</p>

<p class='c014'>These are admirable qualities, but they bring with them
certain disadvantages. Such hasty impressions are often
rather fleeting. When people are carried away by a too
vivid imagination, they do not take time to reflect before
speaking, and run the risk of often having to change their
opinion. Thus Madame de Sévigné has contradicted
herself more than once. But being only a woman of
fashion, her inconsistency has not much weight, and we do
not look on it as a crime. What does it matter to us that
her opinions on Fléchier and Mascaron have varied, that
after having unreservedly admired the <i><span lang="fr">Princesse de Clèves</span></i>
when she read it alone, she hastened to find a thousand
faults in it when her cousin Bussy condemned it? But
Cicero is a politician, and he is expected to be more serious.
We demand that his opinions should have more coherency;
now, this is precisely what the liveliness of his imagination
least permits. He never boasted of being consistent.
When he judges events or men he sometimes passes without
scruple, in a few days, from one extreme to the other. In
a letter of the end of October Cato is called an excellent
friend (<i><span lang="la">amicissimus</span></i>), and the way in which he has acted is
declared to be satisfactory; at the beginning of November
he is accused of having been shamefully malevolent in the
same affair,<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> because Cicero seldom judges but by his
impressions, and in a mobile spirit like his, very different
but equally vivid impressions follow each other very
quickly.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another danger, and one still greater, of this excess of
imagination which cannot control itself is that it may give
us the lowest and most false opinion of those who yield to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>it. Perfect characters are only found in novels. Good
and evil are so intermingled in our nature that the one is
seldom found without the other. The strongest characters
have their weaknesses, and the finest actions do not spring
only from the most honourable motives. Our best affections
are not entirely exempt from selfishness; doubts and
wrongful suspicions sometimes trouble the firmest friendships,
and it may happen at certain moments that cupidity
and jealousy, of which one is ashamed the next day, flit
rapidly through the mind of the most honourable persons.
The prudent and clever carefully conceal all those feelings
which cannot bear the light; those whose quick impressions
carry them away, like Cicero, speak out, and they are very
much blamed. The spoken or written word gives more
strength and permanence to these fugitive thoughts; they
were only flashes; they are fixed and accentuated by
writing; they acquire a clearness, a relief and importance
that they had not in reality. Those momentary weaknesses,
those ridiculous suspicions which spring from wounded
self-esteem, those short bursts of anger, quieted as soon as
reflected on, those unjust thoughts that vexation produces,
those ambitious fits that reason hastens to disavow,
never perish when once they have been confided to a
friend. One of these days a prying commentator will study
these too unreserved disclosures, and will use them, to
draw a portrait of the indiscrete person who made them, to
frighten posterity. He will prove by exact and irrefutable
quotations that he was a bad citizen and a bad friend, that
he loved neither his country nor his family, that he was
jealous of honest people, and that he betrayed all parties.
It is not so, however, and a wise man will not be deceived
by the artifice of misleading quotations. Such a man well
knows that we must not take these impetuous people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>literally or give too much credence to what they say. We
must save them from themselves, refuse to listen to them
when they are led astray by passion, and especially must
we distinguish their real and lasting feelings from all those
exaggerations which are merely passing. For these reasons
every one is not fitted to thoroughly understand these
letters, every one cannot read them as they should be read.
I mistrust those learned men who, without any acquaintance
with men or experience of life, pretend to judge Cicero
from his correspondence. Most frequently they judge him
ill. They search for the expression of his thought in that
commonplace politeness which society demands, and which
no more binds those who use it than it deceives those who
accept it. Those concessions that must be made if we
wish to live together they call cowardly compromises.
They see manifest contradictions in those different shades
a man gives to his opinions, according to the persons he is
talking with. They triumph over the imprudence of certain
admissions, or the fatuity of certain praises, because they
do not perceive the fine irony that tempers them. To
appreciate all these shades, to give things their real importance,
to be a good judge of the drift of those phrases
which are said with half a smile, and do not always mean
what they seem to say, requires more acquaintance with
life than one usually gets in a German university. If I
must say what I think, I would rather trust a man of the
world than a scholar in this matter, for a delicate appreciation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero is not the only person whom this correspondence
shows us. It is full of curious details about all those
who had friendly or business relations with him. They
were the most illustrious persons of the time, and they
played the chief parts in the revolution that put an end to
the Roman Republic. No one deserves to be studied
more than they. It must be remarked here, that one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Cicero’s failings has greatly benefited posterity. If it were
a question of some one else, of Cato for instance, how
many people’s letters would be missing in this correspondence!
The virtuous alone would find a place in it, and
Heaven knows their number was not then very great. But,
happily, Cicero was much more tractable, and did not bring
Cato’s rigorous scruples into the choice of his friends. A
sort of good-nature made him accessible to people of every
opinion; his vanity made him seek praise everywhere.
He had dealings with all parties, a great fault in a politician,
for which the shrewd people of his time have bitterly
reproached him, but a fault that we profit by; hence it
happens that all parties are represented in his correspondence.
This obliging humour sometimes brought him into
contact with people whose opinions were the most opposite
to his, and he found himself at certain times in close
relations with the worst citizens whom he has at other times
lashed with his invectives. Letters that he had received
from Antony, Dolabella, and Curio still remain, and these
letters are full of expressions of respect and friendship. If
the correspondence went further back we should probably
have some of Catiline’s, and, frankly, I regret the want of
them; for if we wish to judge of the state of a society as
of the constitution of a man, it is not enough to examine
the sound parts, we must handle and probe to the bottom
the unsound parts. Thus, all the important men of that
time, whatever their conduct may have been, or to whatever
party they may have belonged, had dealings with Cicero.
Memorials of all are found in his correspondence. A few
of their letters still exist, and we have a large number of
those that Cicero wrote to them. The private details he
gives us about them, what he tells us of their opinions, their
habits, and character, allows us to enter freely into their life.
Thanks to him, all those persons indistinctly depicted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>history resume their original appearance; he seems to bring
them nearer to us and to make us acquainted with them;
and when we have read his correspondence we can say that
we have just visited the whole Roman society of his time.</p>

<p class='c014'>The end we have in view in this book is to study closely
a few of these personages, especially those who were most
involved in the great political events of that period. But
before beginning this study it is necessary to make a firm
resolution not to bring to it considerations which belong to
our own time. It is too much the custom now-a-days to
seek arms for our present struggles in the history of the
past. Smart allusions and ingenious parallels are most
successful. Perhaps Roman antiquity is so much in fashion
only because it gives political parties a convenient and less
dangerous battle-field where, under ancient costumes, present-day
passions may struggle. If the names of Caesar,
Pompey, Cato, and Brutus are quoted on all occasions,
these great men must not be too proud of the honour.
The curiosity they excite is not altogether disinterested, and
when they are spoken of it is almost always to point an
epigram or set off a flattery. I wish to avoid this mistake.
These illustrious dead seem to me to deserve something
better than to serve as instruments in the quarrels that
divide us, and I have sufficient respect for their memory
and their repose not to drag them into the arena of our
every-day disputes. It should never be forgotten that it is
an outrage to history to subject it to the changing interest
of parties, and that it should be, according to the fine
expression of Thucydides, a work made for eternity.</p>

<p class='c014'>These precautions being taken, let us penetrate with
Cicero’s letters into the Roman society of that great period,
and let us begin by studying him who offers himself so
gracefully to do us the honours.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CICERO IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>I<br> CICERO’S PUBLIC LIFE</h3>

<p class='c015'>Cicero’s public life is usually severely judged by the
historians of our time. He pays the penalty of his moderation.
As this period is only studied now with political
intentions, a man like him who tried to avoid extremes
fully satisfies nobody. All parties agree in attacking him;
on all sides he is laughed at or insulted. The fanatical
partisans of Brutus accuse him of timidity, the warmest
friends of Caesar call him a fool. It is in England and
amongst us<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> that he has been least abused, and that
classical traditions have been more respected than elsewhere;
the learned still persist in their old habits and their
old admirations, and in the midst of so many convulsions
criticism at least has remained conservative. Perhaps also
the indulgence shown to Cicero in both countries comes
from the experience they have of political life. When a
man has lived in the practice of affairs and in the midst
of the working of parties, he can better understand the
sacrifices that the necessities of the moment, the interest
of his friends and the safety of his cause may demand of a
statesman, but he who only judges his conduct by inflexible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>theories thought out in solitude and not submitted to the
test of experience becomes more severe towards him. This,
no doubt, is the reason why the German scholars use him
so roughly. With the exception of M. Abeken,<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> who treats
him humanely, they are without pity. Drumann<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> especially
overlooks nothing. He has scrutinized his works and his
life with the minuteness and sagacity of a lawyer seeking
the grounds of a lawsuit. He has laid bare all his correspondence
in a spirit of conscientious malevolence. He has
courageously resisted the charm of those confidential disclosures
which makes us admire the writer and love the
man in spite of his weaknesses, and by opposing to each
other detached fragments of his letters and discourses he
has succeeded in drawing up a formal indictment, in which
nothing is omitted and which almost fills a volume. M.
Mommsen<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> is scarcely more gentle, he is only less long.
Taking a general view of things he does not lose himself
in the details. In two of those compact pages full of facts,
such as he knows how to write, he has found means to
heap on Cicero more insults than Drumann’s whole volume
contains. We see particularly that this pretended statesman
was only an egotist and a short-sighted politician, and
that this great writer is only made up of a newspaper novelist
and a special-pleader. Here we perceive the same pen that
has just written down Cato a Don Quixote and Pompey
a corporal. As in his studies of the past he always has the
present in his mind, one would say that he looks for the
squireens of Prussia in the Roman aristocracy, and that in
Caesar he salutes in advance that popular despot whose
firm hand can alone give unity to Germany.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>How much truth is there in these fierce attacks? What
confidence can we place in this boldness of revolutionary
criticism? What judgment must we pronounce on Cicero’s
political conduct? The study of the facts will teach us.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>I.</h4>

<p class='c015'>Three causes generally contribute to form a man’s political
opinions—his birth, his personal reflections, and his temperament.
If I were not speaking here of sincere convictions
only, I would readily add a fourth, which causes more
conversions than the others, namely interest, that is to say,
that leaning one has almost in spite of oneself to think that
the most advantageous course is also the most just, and to
conform one’s opinion to the position one holds or wishes
for. Let us try and discover what influence these causes
had upon Cicero’s conduct and political preferences.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Rome, for a long time past, opinions had been decided
by birth. In a city where traditions were so much respected
the ideas of parents were inherited as well as their property
or their name, and it was a point of honour to follow their
politics faithfully; but in Cicero’s time these customs were
beginning to decay. The oldest families had no scruple in
failing in their hereditary engagements. At that time many
names which had become illustrious by defending popular
interests are found in the senatorial party, and the most
audacious demagogue of that time bore the name of Clodius.
Besides, Cicero would never at any time have found
political direction in his birth. He belonged to an unknown
family, he was the first of his race to engage in
public affairs, and the name he bore did not commit him
in advance to any party. In fact, he was not born at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Rome. His father lived in one of those little country
municipia of which the wits readily made fun, because
doubtful Latin was spoken and fine manners were not
well known in them, but which, none the less, were the
strength and honour of the Republic. That rude but brave
and temperate people who inhabited the neglected cities of
Campania, Latium, and the Sabine country, and among
whom the habits of rural life had preserved something of
the ancient virtue,<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> was in reality the Roman people. That
which filled the streets and squares of the great city, spent
its time in the theatre, took part in the riots of the Forum,
and sold its votes in the Campus Martius, was only a
collection of freedmen and foreigners among whom only
disorder, intrigue, and corruption could be learnt. Life was
more honest and healthy in the municipia. The citizens
who inhabited them remained for the most part strangers
to the questions that were debated in Rome, and the
rumour of public affairs did not reach them. They were
sometimes seen on the Campus Martius or the Forum,
when it was a question of voting for one of their fellow-citizens,
or of supporting him by their presence before the
tribunals; but usually they troubled themselves little about
exercising their rights, and stayed at home. They were
none the less devoted to their country, jealous of their
privileges, even when they made no use of them, proud of
their title of Roman citizens, and much attached to the
Republican Government that had given it them. For them
the Republic had preserved its prestige because, living at
a distance, they saw less of its weaknesses and always recalled
its ancient glory. Cicero’s childhood was spent in
the midst of these rural populations, as backward in their
ideas as in their manners. He learnt from them to love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the past more than to know the present. This was the
first impression and the first teaching he received from the
places as from the people among whom his early years were
passed. Later, he spoke with emotion of that humble
house that his father had built near the Liris, and which
recalled the house of the old Curius<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> by its stern simplicity.
I fancy that those who lived in it must have thought themselves
carried back a century, and that in causing them to
live among the memorials of the past, it gave them the
inclination and taste for old-fashioned things. If Cicero
owed anything to his birth it was this. He may have
gained in his family respect for the past, love of his country,
and an instinctive preference for the Republican Government,
but he found in it no precise tradition, no positive
engagement with any party. When he entered political life
he was obliged to decide for himself, a great trial for an
irresolute character! And in order to choose among so
many conflicting opinions it was necessary early to study
and reflect.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero has embodied the results of his reflections and
studies in political writings, of which the most important,
<cite>The Republic</cite>, has only reached us in a very imperfect state.
What remains of it shows that he is here, as everywhere
else, a fervent disciple of the Greeks. He attaches himself
by preference to Plato, and his admiration for him is so
strong that he often almost makes us think that he is
content with translating him. In general Cicero does not
appear to care much for the glory of originality. This is
almost the only vanity he lacks. In his correspondence
there is a singular admission on this subject, which has
been freely used against him. In order to make his friend
Atticus understand how his works cost him so little trouble,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>he says: “I only furnish the words, of which I have no
lack”;<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> but Cicero, contrary to his usual custom, calumniates
himself here. He is not such a servile translator as
he wishes to make believe, and the difference between him
and Plato is great, especially in his political works. Their
books bear, indeed, the same title, but as soon as they are
opened we perceive that in reality they are quite unlike.
It is the characteristic of a speculative philosopher like
Plato to consider the absolute end in everything. If he
wants to form a constitution, instead of studying the people
to be governed by it, he begins with some principle which
reason lays down, and follows it up with inflexible rigour to
its logical consequences. Thus he succeeds in forming one
of those political systems where everything is bound and
held together, and which by their admirable unity delight
the mind of the sage who studies them as the regularity of
a fine building pleases the eye of those who look at it. Unfortunately
this kind of constitution, thought out in solitude
and cast all of a piece, is difficult of application. When it
comes to be put in practice unexpected resistance crops up
on all sides. National traditions, character, and recollections,
all those social forces which have been overlooked, will not
submit to the severe laws imposed on them. It is then
perceived that these things cannot be moulded at will,
and since they absolutely refuse to give way, one must be
prepared to modify this constitution which seemed so fine
when it was not put into use. But here again the difficulty
is great. It is not easy to change anything in these compact
and logical systems, where everything is so skilfully arranged
that one piece being disturbed throws the rest out of
gear. Besides, philosophers are naturally imperious and
absolute; they do not like to be thwarted. To avoid that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>opposition that provokes them, to escape as much as
possible the demands of reality, they imitate the Athenian
of whom Aristophanes speaks, who, despairing of finding
here below a republic to suit him, went to look for one
in the clouds. They also build castles in the air, ideal
republics governed by imaginary laws. They frame admirable
constitutions, but they have the defect of not
applying to any particular country because they are made
for the whole human race.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero did not act thus. He knew the public he addressed;
he knew that that grave and sensible race, so quick to
seize the practical side of things, would be ill-satisfied with
these fancies, and so he does not lose himself in these
dreams of the ideal and the absolute. He does not presume
to make laws for the universe; he is thinking especially of
his own country and his own times, and although he appears
to be drawing up the plan of a perfect republic, that is to
say, one that cannot exist, it is plain that his eyes are fixed
on a constitution which does really exist. The following are
very nearly his political theories. Of the three forms of
government usually distinguished, none altogether pleases
him when it is isolated. I need not speak of the absolute
government of a single man, he died in order to oppose that.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The other two, government by all or by a few, that is to
say democracy and aristocracy, do not seem to him faultless
either. It is difficult to be quite contented with the aristocracy
when one has not the advantage of belonging
to a great family. The Roman aristocracy, notwithstanding
the great qualities it displayed in the conquest and
government of the world, was supercilious and exclusive
like others. The checks it had suffered for a century,
its visible decline, and the feeling it must have had of
its approaching end, far from curing its pride, rendered it
more intractable. Prejudices seem to become narrower and
more inflexible when they have but a short time to live. We
know how our <i><span lang="fr">émigrés</span></i>, face to face with a victorious revolution,
used up their last strength in foolish struggles for
precedence. In the same way the Roman nobility, at the
moment when the power was slipping from it, seemed to
make a point of exaggerating its defects, and of discouraging
by its disdain the respectable people who offered themselves
to defend it. Cicero felt himself drawn towards it by his
taste for refinement of manners and elegant pleasures; but
he could not endure its insolence. Thus he always kept up
the ill-will of the discontented plebeian against it, even while
serving it. He knew very well that his birth was not overlooked,
and that he was called an upstart (<i><span lang="la">homo novus</span></i>), and
in return he was never tired of jesting about those fortunate
people who do not need to have any merit, who do not
require to take trouble, and to whom the highest places in
the republic come while they are sleeping (<i><span lang="la">quibus omnia
populi romani beneficia dormientibus deferuntur</span></i>).<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>But if aristocracy pleased him little, he liked popular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>government still less. It is the worst of all, he said, anticipating
Corneille,<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> and in saying so he followed the opinion
of the greater number of the Greek philosophers, his masters,
who have almost all shown a great aversion to democracy.
They were not only kept aloof from the multitude by the
nature of their studies, pursued in silence and solitude, but
they carefully shunned it lest they should partake of its
errors and prejudices. Their constant care was to keep
themselves outside and above it. The pride that this isolation
nourished in them prevented them seeing an equal in a
man of the people, a stranger to those studies they were so
proud of. Thus the supremacy of numbers, which gives the
same importance to the unlearned as to the sage, was distasteful
to them. Cicero says positively that equality understood
in this way is the greatest inequality, <i><span lang="la">ipsa aequitas
iniquissima est</span></i>.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a> This was not the only nor even the greatest
reproach that the Greek philosophers, and Cicero with them,
threw on democracy. They thought it was naturally restless
and turbulent, the enemy of meditation, and that it does not
give that leisure to the learned and the sage which is needful
for the works they are projecting. When Cicero thought
of popular government, he had in his mind only wrangles
and faction-fights. He recalled the plebeian riots and the
stormy scenes of the Forum. He fancied he heard those
threatening complaints of the debtors and the needy which
had troubled the repose of the rich for three hundred years.
How could any one apply himself amidst this turmoil to
studies which require peace and quietness? The pleasures
of the mind are interrupted every moment in this reign of
violence, which constantly drags people from the tranquillity
of their library into the public streets. This tumultuous and
unstable life was ill suited to such a firm friend of study, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>if the arrogance of the nobles sometimes threw him towards
the popular party, dislike of violence and noise did not allow
him to remain in it.</p>

<p class='c014'>What form of government then seemed to him the best?
That which unites them all in a just equilibrium—he says so
very plainly in his <em>Republic</em>. “I should wish that there be in
the state a supreme and royal power, that another part be
reserved for the authority of the chief citizens, and that certain
things be left to the judgment and will of the people.”<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> Now
this mixed and limited government is not, according to him,
an imaginary system, like the republic of Plato. It is in
actual existence and working; it is that of his own country.
This opinion has been much contested. M. Mommsen
thinks it agrees as little with philosophy as with history.
Taking it strictly, it is certainly more patriotic than true.
It would be going very far to consider the Roman
constitution as a faultless model, and to close our eyes
to its defects at the very moment when it perished
through those very defects; yet it must be admitted that,
with all its imperfections, it was one of the wisest of
ancient times, and that none, perhaps, had made so many
efforts to satisfy the two great needs of society—order and
liberty. Nor can it be denied that its chief merit consisted
in its effort to unite and reconcile the different forms of
government, notwithstanding their obvious antagonisms.
Polybius had perceived this before Cicero, and it derives this
merit from its origin and the way in which it was formed.
The constitution of Greece had almost all been the work of
one man, the Roman constitution was the work of time.
That skilful balance of powers that Polybius admired so
much, had not been contrived by one foreseeing mind. We
do not find in the early times of Rome a single legislator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>who regulated in advance the part each social element was
to play in the general combination; these elements combined
by themselves. The seditions of the plebeians, the
desperate struggles of the tribunate with the patricians,
which terrified Cicero, had contributed more than all the
rest to complete that constitution that he admired. After a
struggle of nearly two hundred years, when the opposing
forces perceived that they were not able to destroy each
other, they resigned themselves to unite, and from the efforts
they made to agree together there resulted a government,
imperfect doubtless—can there be a perfect one?—but which
is none the less the best, perhaps, of the ancient world. We
remember, of course, that Cicero did not bestow this praise
on the Roman constitution as it was in his time. His
admiration went further back. He recognized that it had been
profoundly modified since the time of the Gracchi, but he
thought that before it had undergone these alterations it was
irreproachable. Thus the studies of his riper age carried
him back to those first impressions of his childhood, and
strengthened his love of ancient times and his respect for
ancient customs. As he advanced in life all his mistakes
and all his misfortunes threw him back to that time. The
more the present was sad and the future threatening the
more he looked back with regret on the past. If he had
been asked in what time he would have wished to have been
born, I think he would have unhesitatingly chosen the
period that followed the Punic wars, that is to say, the
moment when Rome, proud of her victory, confident in the
future and dreaded by the world, caught a glimpse for the
first time of the beauties of Greece, and began to feel
the charm of letters and the arts. Cicero considers this
Rome’s best time, and places in it by preference the scene
of his dialogues. He would certainly have liked to live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>among those great men whom he causes to speak so well, in
the company of Scipio, Fabius, and Cato the Elder, by the
side of Lucilius and Terence; and in this illustrious group,
the personage whose life and career would most have
tempted him, he that he would have wished to be, if a man
could choose his time and order his destiny, was the wise
and learned Laelius.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a> To unite, like him, a high political
situation to the cultivation of literature, to add to the
supreme authority of eloquence some military successes,
which the greatest preachers of pacific triumphs do not disdain,
to reach the highest dignities of the republic in quiet
and orderly times, and after an honourable life to enjoy a
respected old age—this was Cicero’s ideal. What regrets
and sadness does he not experience, when he wakes from
this fine dream to the disappointments of reality, and instead
of living in a tranquil republic, and in free intercourse with
the Scipios, he must be the rival of Catiline, the victim of
Clodius, and the subject of Caesar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero’s temperament, I think, had still more to do with
his political preferences than his birth or his reflections.
There is no more to learn about the weaknesses of his
character; they have been laid bare with delight, they have
even been wilfully exaggerated, and since Montaigne it is
the usual thing to laugh at them. I need not repeat, then,
what has been said so often, that he was timid, hesitating,
and irresolute. I admit with everybody that nature made
him a man of letters rather than a politician, but I do
not think that this admission does him so much harm as
might be thought. The mind of the man of letters is often
more perfect, more comprehensive, broader than that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>politician, and it is precisely this breadth that cramps and
thwarts him when he undertakes public affairs. We ask
ourselves what qualities are necessary for a statesman; would
it not be wiser to seek those it is good for him to lack, and does
not political capacity show itself sometimes in its limitations
and exclusions? A man of action who ought to decide
quickly may be hampered by the number of contradictory
reasons a too close and penetrating view of things may
present to him. A too vivid imagination, showing him
many plans at once, prevents him fixing on any. Determination
often comes from narrowness of mind, and is
one of the greatest virtues in a politician. A very sensitive
conscience, by making him too particular in the choice of
his allies, would deprive him of powerful support. He must
distrust those generous impulses which lead him to do justice
even to his enemies: in the furious struggle for power a
man runs the risk of disarming himself and allowing an
advantage to be taken if he has the misfortune to be just and
tolerant. There is nothing that may not become a danger
for him, even to that natural uprightness, the first quality of
a statesman. If he is too sensitive to the excesses and acts
of injustice of his party he will serve it feebly, if his fidelity
is to be unshaken he must not only excuse, he should be
able to shut his eyes to them. These are some of the
imperfections of heart and mind by which he gains his
successes. If it be true, as I believe it is, that the politician
often succeeds in the government of a state through his
defects, and that the literary man fails by his very qualities,
it is paying the latter almost a compliment to say he is not
fit for the management of affairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>We may say then without discrediting Cicero, that he was
not altogether fit for public life. The causes which made
him an incomparable writer did not allow him to be a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>politician. That openness to impressions, that delicate and
irritable sensitiveness, the principal sources of his literary
talent, did not leave him sufficiently master of his will.
Particular events had too great a hold on him, and a man
must be able to detach himself from these in order to
control them. His versatile and fertile imagination, by
drawing his attention to all sides at once, rather incapacitated
him for forming well-connected plans. He could not
delude himself enough about men or enterprises, and thus
he was subject to sudden fits of irresolution. He often
boasted of having foreseen and predicted the future. It
was certainly not in his position of augur, but by a kind of
troublesome perspicacity, that showed him the consequences
of events, and the bad ones rather than the good. On
the nones of December, when he executed Catiline’s
accomplices, he did not forget the vengeance to which he
exposed himself, and he foresaw his exile: that day then,
notwithstanding the irresolution he has been reproached
with, he had more courage than another who in a moment
of excitement would not have seen the danger. One cause
of his inferiority and weakness was that he was moderate,
moderate by constitution rather than principle, that is to
say, with that nervous and irritable impatience which at
last employs violence to defend moderation. In political
struggles all excess can seldom be avoided. Usually parties
are unjust in their complaints when they are beaten, cruel
in their reprisals when they conquer, and ready to do
without scruple, as soon as they are able, what they blame
in their enemies. If any in the victorious party perceive
they are going too far and dare to say so, they inevitably
irritate everybody against them. They are accused of
timidity and vacillation, they are called weak and changeable;
but is this reproach well deserved? Did Cicero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>contradict himself when, after defending the unfortunate
men whom the aristocracy oppressed under Sulla, he defended,
thirty years later, the victims of the democracy under
Caesar? Was he not, on the contrary, more consistent than
those who, after bitterly complaining of being exiled, exiled
their enemies as soon as they had the power? We must,
however, admit that if this lively sense of justice is honourable
in a private man it may become dangerous in a
politician. Parties do not like those who refuse to join in
their excesses, and in the midst of general licence set up
the claim of alone remaining within bounds. It was Cicero’s
misfortune not to have that firm resolution which fixes
a man in his opinions, and to pass from one opinion to
another, because he saw clearly the good and evil of all.
A man must be very self-reliant to try and do without
others. This isolation takes for granted a decision and
energy that were wanting in Cicero. If he had resolutely
attached himself to one party he would have found in it
traditions and fixed principles, firm friends and steady
leading, and need only have allowed himself to be led. On
the other hand, by endeavouring to walk alone he risked
making all the rest his enemies while he himself had no
clearly marked out line of conduct. A glance at the chief
events of his political life is sufficient to show that this was
the origin of a part of his misfortunes and his faults.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>II.</h4>

<p class='c015'>What I have just said of Cicero’s character explains his
early political opinions. He first appeared in the Forum
under the government of Sulla. The aristocracy was then
all-powerful, and strangely abused its power. Having been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>conquered for a moment by Marius its reprisals had been
terrible. Tumultuous and indiscriminate massacres could
not appease its rage. Applying its cold and orderly spirit
to murder itself, it had invented proscription, which was only
another way of organizing assassination. After having thus
satisfied its vengeance it began to strengthen its authority.
It had dispossessed the richest municipia of Italy of their
property, excluded the knights from the tribunals, lessened
the privileges of the popular comitia, deprived the tribunes
of the right of intervention, that is, it had levelled everything
around itself. When it had broken down all resistance
by the death of its enemies, and concentrated all power in
itself, it solemnly declared that the revolution was ended,
that legal government would recommence, and that “killing
would cease after the kalends of June.” Notwithstanding
these pompous declarations, massacres still continued for
a long time. Assassins, protected by the freedmen of Sulla,
who shared the profits with them, went out by night into the
dark and crooked streets of the old city, even to the foot
of the Palatine. They murdered rich men returning home,
and under some pretext or other obtained their property
from the courts of justice, no one daring to complain.
Such was the government under which men lived at Rome
when Cicero pleaded his first causes. A moderate man like
him, to whom excess was distasteful, must have had a horror
of this violence. An aristocratic tyranny did not suit him
better than a popular tyranny. Before this abuse of
authority that the nobility allowed itself he felt himself
naturally drawn to aid the democracy, and he began his
career in the ranks of its defenders.</p>

<p class='c014'>He made a bold and splendid beginning. In the midst
of that silent terror that the memory of the proscriptions
kept up, he dared to speak out, and the universal silence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>gave a louder echo to his words. His political importance
dates from the defence of Roscius. This unfortunate man,
whose property had been first taken, and who had then been
accused of murdering his father, could find no defender.
Cicero undertook his defence. He was young and unknown,
two great advantages in undertaking these bold
strokes, for obscurity diminishes the danger which a man
runs, and youth prevents the seeing it. He had no trouble
in proving the innocence of his client, who was accused
without evidence; but this success was not enough for
him. It was known that one of the most powerful freedmen
of Sulla, the rich and voluptuous Chrysogonus, was the
hidden mover of the accusation. No doubt he thought
the dread his name inspired was a sufficient protection
against the boldness of the defence. Cicero dragged him
into the case. Traces of the dismay that seized the audience
when they heard this dreaded name are perceptible in his
speech. The accusers were dumfoundered, the multitude
remained silent. The young orator alone seemed tranquil
and self-possessed. He smiled, he joked, he dared to jeer
at those terrible men whom no one else dared look in
the face, because in doing so they thought of the two
thousand heads of knights and senators they had cut off.
He does not altogether respect the master himself. That
surname, “the happy,” that his flatterers had given him gave
rise to a pun. “What man is <em>happy</em> enough,” says he, “not
to have some rascal in his train?”<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> This rascal is no
other than the all-powerful Chrysogonus. Cicero does not
spare him. He depicts his vulgar luxury and arrogance.
He shows him heaping up in his house on the Palatine all
the precious objects that he had taken from his victims,
annoying the neighbourhood with the noise of his singers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>musicians, “or hovering about the Forum with his hair well
combed and shining with unguents.”<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> More serious accusations
are mingled with these jests. The word proscriptions
is sometimes pronounced in this speech, the memory and
impression they have left is found everywhere. We feel
that the speaker, who has seen them, has his mind full of
the subject, and that the horror that he feels and that he
cannot master prevents him keeping silence whatever danger
there may be in speaking. This generous emotion shows
itself every moment, in spite of the reticence the neighbourhood
of the proscribers imposes. Speaking of their victims,
he dares to say that they have been cruelly murdered,
though it was usual to attribute to them every kind of crime.
He holds up to public scorn and hatred the wretches who
have enriched themselves by these massacres, and with a
successful pun calls them “cut-heads and cut-purses.”<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
He then demands formally that an end should be put
to these proceedings, of which humanity was ashamed;
“otherwise,” he adds, “it would be better to go and live
among wild beasts than to remain in Rome.”<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero spoke thus at a few paces from the man who had
ordered the proscriptions, and in the presence of those who
had carried them out and profited by them. We can
imagine the effect his words must have produced. They
expressed the secret feelings of all, they relieved the public
conscience, forced to keep silence, and humiliated by its
silence. Thus the democratic party showed the most lively
sympathy, from that time, for the eloquent young man who
protested so courageously against a hateful rule. The
remembrance of this preserved the popular favour for him
so faithfully even to the time of his consulship. Every
time he sought an office the citizens hastened in crowds to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the Campus Martius to record their votes for him. No
politician of that time, and there were many more eminent
than he, so easily reached the highest dignities. Cato
suffered more than one check, Caesar and Pompey needed
coalitions and intrigues to succeed. Cicero is almost the
only one whose candidatures succeeded the first time, and
who never had to recur to the means usually required for
success. In the midst of those scandalous bargains which
gave honours to the richest, notwithstanding those deeprooted
traditions which seemed to reserve them for the
noblest, Cicero, who had no claims of birth and but a small
fortune, always defeated all the rest. He was appointed
quaestor, aedile; he obtained the urban praetorship, which
was the most honourable; he attained the consulship the
first time he sought for it, as soon as the law permitted him
to aspire to it, and none of these dignities cost anything
either to his honour or his fortune.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is worthy of remark, that when he was appointed praetor
he had not delivered any political speech. Up to the age
of forty years he was only what we call an advocate, and
had not felt the need of being anything else. Forensic
eloquence then led to everything; a few brilliant successes
before the tribunals were sufficient to carry a man to public
dignities, and nobody thought of asking Cicero for any other
proof of his capacity for public business, when they were
about to commit the highest interests of his country to his
charge, and to invest him with the supreme authority.
However, if this long time passed at the bar was not
detrimental to his political career, I think it caused some
injury to his talents. All the reproaches we may address
to the advocate of to-day, wrongly, no doubt, were well
deserved by the advocate of those times. It may be said
of him with truth, that he took all cases indifferently, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>he changed his opinion with each suit, that he used all his
art in and made his fame by finding good reasons for supporting
every sophism. The young man who devoted himself to
oratory in the ancient schools, never heard it said that it was
necessary to be convinced, and proper only to speak conscientiously.
He was taught that there are different kinds
of cases, those which are honest and those which are not
so (<i><span lang="la">genera causarum sunt honestum, turpe</span></i>, etc.).<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> It was
not thought necessary to add that the latter were to be
avoided. On the contrary, by exaggerating the merit of
success in these, he acquired the taste for undertaking them
by preference. After he had been taught how to defend
and save the guilty, he was, without hesitation, also taught
how to bring discredit on an honest man. Such was the
education received by the pupil of the rhetoricians, and
when he had quitted their schools he did not lack opportunity
of applying their precepts. For instance, he did not
make the mistake of being moderate and restrained in his
attacks. By constraining himself to be just he would have
deprived himself of an element of success with that fickle
and passionate mob which applauded satirical portraits and
violent invective. He was not more prejudiced in favour
of truth than of justice. It was a precept of the schools to
invent, even in criminal causes, racy and imaginary details
that diverted the audience (<i><span lang="la">causam mendaciunculis adspergere</span></i>).<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
Cicero quotes with great commendation some of
these agreeable little lies which perhaps cost the honour or
the life of some unfortunate people who were unlucky
enough to have too witty opponents, and as he had himself
a fertile imagination in this way, he did not stint himself in
having recourse to this easy means of success. Nothing was
more indifferent to the ancient advocate than being inconsistent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>with himself. It was said that the orator Antonius
never would write any of his speeches, lest some one should
take it into his head to compare his late with his present
opinion. Cicero had not these scruples. He contradicted
himself all his life, and was never uneasy about it. One
day, when he too openly stated the contrary to what he
had formerly upheld, as he was pressed to explain these
sudden changes, he answered without perturbation: “You
are mistaken if you think that you find the expression of
our personal opinions in our speeches; they are the language
of the cause and the case, and not that of the man
and the orator.”<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> This at least is a sincere avowal; but
how much do the orator and the man not lose by thus
suiting their language to circumstances! They learnt to be
careless of putting order and consistency in their lives, to
dispense with sincerity in their opinions, and conviction in
their speech, to make the same expenditure of talent for
untruth as for truth, to consider only the needs of the
moment, and the success of the case in hand. These are
the lessons that the bar of that age taught Cicero. He
remained at it too long, and when he quitted it at forty to
make his first essay in political oratory, he could not shake
off the bad habits acquired there.</p>

<p class='c014'>Does this mean that Cicero should be struck off the list
of political orators? If this name is given to every man
whose speech has some influence on the affairs of his
country, who sways the mob, or convinces honest people,
it seems difficult to refuse it to Cicero. He knew how
to talk to the multitude and make himself listened to. At
times he mastered it in its most furious outbursts. He
made it accept and even applaud opinions contrary to its
preferences. He seemed to drag it out of its apathy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to call up in it for a short time an appearance of energy
and patriotism. He is not to blame if his successes were
not followed up, if after these grand triumphs of eloquence
brute force remained master. At least he did with his
words all that words could then do. I admit, however,
that what was wanting in his character was wanting also in
his political eloquence. It is nowhere sufficiently resolute,
decided, practical. It is too much taken up with itself, and
not enough with the questions it is treating. It does not
attack them boldly on their salient points. It is involved in
pompous phrases, instead of trying to speak that clear and
precise language which is the language of public business.
When we examine it closely, and begin to analyze it, we
find that it is chiefly composed of a good deal of rhetoric
and a little philosophy. All those agreeable and smart
arguments, all those artifices of debate, and also all that
ostentation of pathos that we find in it, come from rhetoric.
Philosophy has furnished those grand commonplaces developed
with talent, but not always germane to the subject.
There is too much artifice and method about it. A concise
and simple statement would be more suitable to the discussion
of affairs than these subtleties and emotions; these
long philosophical tirades would be advantageously replaced
by a clear and judicious exposition of the orator’s principles
and of the general ideas that regulate his conduct. Unfortunately,
as I have said, Cicero preserved, on reaching
the rostrum, the habits he had acquired at the bar. He
attacks, with the arguments of an advocate, that agrarian law,
so honest, moderate, and wise, which was proposed by the
tribune Rullus. In the fourth Catilinarian Oration he had
to discuss this question, one of the gravest that can be
placed before a deliberative assembly, namely, how far is it
permitted to deviate from legality in order to save one’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>country? He has not even approached it. It is painful to
see how he hangs back from it, how he flies from and avoids
it, to develop small reasons and lose himself in a vulgar
pathos. The grave and serious kind of eloquence evidently
was not that which Cicero preferred, and in which he felt
most at ease. If you wish to know the real tendency of
his talents, read, immediately after the fourth Catilinarian
Oration, the speech for Muraena, delivered at the same
time. There is none more agreeable in the collection of
his speeches, and we wonder how a man who was consul,
and who had then so many affairs on his hands, found his
mind sufficiently free to joke with so much ease and point;
the truth is, there he was in his element. Accordingly,
although he was consul or consular, he returned to the bar
as often as he could. It was to oblige his friends, he said. I
think that he wished still more to please himself; he appears
happy, and his animation and wit expand so freely, when
he has some agreeable and lively case to plead. Not only
did he never miss an opportunity of appearing before
the judges, but as much as possible he threw his
political discourses into the form of ordinary pleadings.
Everything turned into personal questions with him. The
discussion of ideas usually leaves him cold. He had to
contend against some one in order to let us see him at his
best. The finest speeches he delivered in the Forum or the
senate are eulogies or invectives. In them he is unrivalled;
in them, according to one of his expressions, his eloquence
rises and triumphs; but however fine invectives and eulogies
may be, they are not altogether our ideal of political
eloquence, and we demand something else of it now-a-days.
All that can be said in justification of Cicero’s speeches is,
that they were perfectly appropriate to his time, and that
their character is explained by the circumstances in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>they were delivered. Eloquence did not then guide the
state as in the best times of the republic. Other influences
had replaced it; in the elections, money and the intrigues
of the candidates, in out-door discussions, the occult and
terrible power of the popular societies, and above all the
army, which, since Sulla, raised or overthrew every government.
Eloquence feels itself powerless in the midst of
these forces which overpower it. How can it still preserve
the commanding accent, the imperious and resolute tone of
one who knows his power? Need it appeal to reason and
logic, and try and force itself upon men’s convictions by
a close and forcible argument, when it knows that the
questions it is treating are decided otherwise? M. Mommsen
maliciously remarks, that in most of his great political
speeches Cicero pleads causes already victorious. When
he published the Verrine Orations, the laws of Sulla on the
composition of the tribunals had just been abolished. He
well knew that Catiline had decided to leave Rome when
he pronounced the first Catilinarian Oration, in which he so
feelingly adjures him to go away. The second Philippic,
which seems so bold when we think of it as spoken to
the face of the all-powerful Antony, was only made public
at the moment when Antony was flying to Cisalpine Gaul.
Of what use then were all these fine speeches? They did
not cause decisions to be taken, since these decisions were
already taken; but they caused them to be accepted by the
multitude, they stirred public opinion and excited it in their
favour: this was something. It was necessary to accept
the facts of the situation; speech no longer governed,
eloquence could no longer hope to direct events, but it
acted on them indirectly, it tried to produce those great
movements of opinion that prepare or complete them;
“it does not secure votes and acts, it arouses the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>emotions.”<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a> If this moral effect is the only end it had in
view at the time, Cicero’s eloquence, by its copiousness and
splendour, by its brilliancy and pathos, was well calculated
to attain it.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first he had put his eloquence at the service of the
popular party; we have seen that it was in the ranks of this
party that he made his first political appearance; but
although he faithfully served it for seventeen years, I am
inclined to think that he did not always do so heartily.
The excesses of the aristocratic government threw him
towards democracy, but he must have found democracy not
much wiser, especially when it was victorious. It sometimes
gave him terrible clients to defend. He had to plead the
cause of factious and seditious persons who were always
troubling the public peace. One day he even pleaded, or
was on the point of pleading, for Catiline. It is probable
that all this was painful to him, and that the violent excesses
of democracy tempted him more than once to separate from
it. Unfortunately he did not know where to go if he left it,
and if the plebeians offended him by their violence, the
aristocracy, by its arrogance and prejudices, did not any
more attract him. Since in existing parties he did not find
any which exactly corresponded to his convictions, and
which altogether suited his disposition, he had no other
resource than to form one for himself. This is what he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>tried to do. When he felt that the brilliancy of his
eloquence, the offices he had filled, the popularity that
surrounded him, made him an important person, in order to
assure his future, to take a higher and more permanent
position in the republic, to free himself from the requirements
of his former protectors, in order not to be forced to
stretch out his hand to his old enemies, he sought to create
a new party, composed of the moderate men of all parties,
and of which he was to be the head. But he very well
understood that he could not create this party in a
moment and produce it from nothing. It was necessary
first to find a nucleus around which the new recruits that he
expected should group themselves. He thought he had
found it in that class of citizens to which he belonged by
his birth, and who were called the knights.</p>

<p class='c014'>Rome always lacked what we now call the middle and
citizen class. In proportion as the small farmers left their
friends to go and live in the city, and “as those hands which
had worked at the corn and the vine were only occupied
in applauding at the theatre and the circus,”<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> the gap
became greater between the opulent aristocracy which possessed
almost all the public wealth, and that indigent and
famished people that was continually recruited from the
slaves. The sole intermediaries were the knights. This
name, at the time we are considering, was not only used to
describe the citizens to whom the state gave a horse (<i><span lang="la">equites
equo publico</span></i>), and who voted separately in the elections; it
was also given to all those who possessed the equestrian
income qualification, that is to say, those whose fortune
exceeded 400,000 sesterces (£3200). We may well believe
that the nobility behaved haughtily to these obscure plebeians
whom chance or economy had enriched; it kept these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>parvenus at a distance; dealt out its disdain to them as
liberally as to the poor people of the plebs, and obstinately
closed the entrance to public dignities to them. When
Cicero was appointed consul it was thirty years since a new
man, whether knight or plebeian, had attained the consulship.
Removed from political life by the jealousy of the great
nobles, the knights were obliged to turn their energies
elsewhere. Instead of wasting time in useless candidatures,
they busied themselves in making their fortunes. When
Rome had conquered the world, it was the knights
especially who profited by these conquests. They formed
an industrious and enlightened class, they were already
in easy circumstances, and able to make loans, and thought
they could speculate in the conquered countries for their
own profit. Penetrating wherever the Roman arms were
carried, they became merchants, bankers, farmers of the
taxes, and amassed immense riches. As Rome was no longer
the Rome of the Curii and the Cincinnati, and dictators
were no longer taken from the plough, their wealth gave
them consideration and importance. From that time they
were spoken of with more respect. The Gracchi, who
wished to make them allies in the struggle they were
waging with the aristocracy, caused it to be decided that
the judges should be taken from their ranks. Cicero went
further; he tried to make them the foundation of the great
moderate party he wished to create. He knew that he
could count on their devotedness. He belonged to them
by birth; he had shed over them the splendour that
surrounded his name; he had never neglected to defend
their interests before the tribunals or in the senate. He
also reckoned that they would be grateful to him for wishing
to augment their importance and call them to a great
political future.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>All these combinations of Cicero seemed at first to
succeed very happily; but, to tell the truth, the merit of
this success was chiefly due to circumstances. This great
coalition of the moderates upon which he congratulated
himself as his finest work, almost succeeded under the
influence of fear. A social revolution seemed imminent.
The dregs of all the old parties, wretched plebeians and
ruined nobles, old soldiers of Marius, and proscribers of
Sulla, had united under the leadership of a bold and able
chief, who promised them a new distribution of public
wealth. The existence of this party compelled those whom
it threatened to unite also in order to defend themselves.
Fear was more efficacious than the finest speeches would
have been, and in this sense we may say that Cicero was
perhaps more indebted for this union which he regarded as
the main point of his policy to Catiline rather than to himself.
Community of interests, then, brought about, at least
for a time, a reconciliation of the aims of various classes.
The richest, and consequently the most seriously endangered,
namely the knights, were naturally the soul of the new
party. By their side the honest plebeians who did not wish
political reforms to be exaggerated took their stand, as well
as those nobles whose threatened pleasures drew them from
their apathy, who would have allowed the republic to perish
without defending it, but who did not wish their lampreys
and fish-ponds touched. The new party had not to look
about long for a head. Pompey was in Asia, Caesar and
Crassus secretly favoured the conspiracy. Besides these
there was no greater name than Cicero’s. This explains
that great wave of public opinion which carried him into the
consulship. His election was almost a triumph. I shall
say nothing of his consulship, of which he has had the
misfortune to speak too much himself. I do not wish to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>underrate the victory that he gained over Catiline and
his accomplices. The danger was serious; even his enemy
Sallust affirms it. Behind the plot were hidden ambitious
politicians ready to profit by events. Caesar knew well
that the reign of anarchy could not last long. After some
pillaging and massacres, Rome would have recovered from
her surprise, and honest folks, being driven to activity by
despair, would have again got the upper hand. Only it is
probable that then one of those reactions that usually follow
great anarchy would have taken place. The remembrance
of the ills from which they had escaped with such difficulty
would have disposed many people to sacrifice the liberty
which exposed them to so many perils, and Caesar held
himself ready to offer them the sovereign remedy of absolute
power. By cutting the evil at the root, by surprising and
punishing the conspiracy before it broke out, Cicero perhaps
delayed the advent of monarchical government at Rome for
fifteen years. He was not wrong, then, in boasting of the
services he rendered at that time to his country’s liberty,
and we must acknowledge, with Seneca, that if he has
praised his consulship without measure he has not done so
without reason.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Coalitions of this kind, unfortunately, seldom long survive
the circumstances that give rise to them. When the
interests that a common danger had united began to feel
themselves secure, they recommenced their old quarrels.
The plebeians, who were no longer afraid, felt their old
animosity against the nobility revive. The nobles began
again to envy the wealth of the knights. As to the
knights, they had none of those qualities that were necessary
to make them the soul of a political party, as Cicero
had hoped. They were more occupied with their private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>affairs than with those of the republic. They had not the
strength of numbers, like the plebeians, and were wanting in
those great traditions of government that maintained so long
the authority of the nobility. Their only guiding principle
was that instinct usual with men of large fortunes, which
led them to prefer order to liberty. They sought, before all
things, a strong power which could defend them, and Caesar
had in the end no more devoted followers than they. In
this break-up of his party, Cicero, who could not stand
alone, asked himself on which side he ought to place
himself. The fright that Catiline had given him, the presence
of Caesar and Crassus in the ranks of the democracy,
prevented his return to that party, and he finally attached
himself to the nobility, notwithstanding his repugnance.
From the date of his consulship he resolutely turned towards
this party. We know how the democracy avenged itself for
what it considered a betrayal. Three years after it condemned
its old head, now become its enemy, to exile, and
only consented to recall him to cast him at the feet of
Caesar and Pompey, whose union had made them masters
of Rome.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c011'>III.</h4>

<p class='c015'>The gravest political crisis that Cicero passed through,
after the great struggles of his consulship, was certainly that
which terminated in the fall of the Roman republic at
Pharsalia. We know that he did not willingly engage in
this terrible conflict, of which he foresaw the issue, and that
he hesitated for nearly a year before deciding on his course.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>It is not surprising that he hesitated so long. He was no
longer young and obscure as when he pleaded for Roscius.
He had a high position and an illustrious name that he
did not wish to compromise, and a man may be allowed
to reflect before he risks fortune, glory, and perchance life
on a single cast. Besides, the question was not so simple
nor the right so clear as they seem at first sight. Lucan,
whose sympathies are not doubtful, yet said that it could
not be known on which side justice lay, and this obscurity
does not seem to be altogether dissipated, since,
after eighteen centuries of discussion, posterity has not yet
succeeded in coming to an agreement. It is curious that,
among us, in the seventeenth century, at the height of
monarchical government, the learned all pronounced against
Caesar without hesitation. Magistrates of the high courts,
men cautious and moderate by their offices and character,
who approached the king and were not sparing of flattery,
took the liberty of being Pompeians and even furious Pompeians
in private. “The First President,” says Guy-Patin,
“is so much on Pompey’s side, that one day he expressed
his joy that I was so, I having said to him, in his fine garden
at Bâville, that if I had been in the senate when Julius
Caesar was killed, I would have given him the twenty-fourth
stab.” On the contrary, it is in our own days, in a democratic
epoch, after the French Revolution, and in the name
of the revolution and the democracy, that the side of Caesar
has been upheld with the greatest success, and that the
benefit humanity has reaped from his victory has been set
in its clearest light.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have no intention to re-open this debate, it is too fertile
in stormy discussions. I only wish here to deal with so
much of it as is indispensable to explain Cicero’s political
life. There are, I think, two very different ways of looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>at the question: our own first, namely, that of people unconcerned
in these quarrels of a former age, who approach
them as historians or philosophers, after time has cooled
them, who judge them less by their causes than by their
results, and who ask themselves, above all, what good or
evil they have done in the world; then that of contemporaries,
who judge of them with their passions and prejudices,
according to the ideas of their time, in their relation to
themselves, and without knowing their remote consequences.
I am going to place myself solely at this latter point of view,
although the other seems to me grander and more profitable;
but as my only design is to ask from Cicero an explanation
of his political actions, and as one cannot reasonably require
of him that he should have divined the future, I shall confine
myself to showing how the question was stated in his
time, what reasons were alleged on both sides, and in what
manner it was natural for a wise man who loved his country
to appreciate those reasons. Let us forget, then, the eighteen
centuries that separate us from these events, let us suppose
ourselves at Formiae or Tusculum during those long days of
anxiety and uncertainty that Cicero passed there, and let us
hear him discuss, with Atticus or Curio, the reasons that the
two parties urged to draw him into their ranks.</p>

<p class='c014'>What shows plainly that the judgment of contemporaries
on the events which pass before them is not the same as
that of posterity is, that the friends of Caesar, when they
wished to gain over Cicero, did not employ the argument
that seems the best to us. The chief reason that is appealed
to now to justify Caesar’s victory is that, on the whole, if by
it Rome lost some of her privileges, it was for the advantage
of the rest of the world that she was despoiled. What does
it matter that a few thousand men, who did not make a very
good use of their political liberty, were deprived of it, if by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the same stroke almost the entire world was rescued from
pillage, slavery, and ruin? It is certain that the provinces
and their inhabitants, so roughly treated by the proconsuls
of the republic, found themselves better off under the <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i>
inaugurated by Caesar. His army was open to all foreigners;
he had with him Germans, Gauls, and Spaniards. They
helped him to conquer, and naturally profited by his victory:
and this was, without his wishing it perhaps, the revenge of
the conquered nations. These nations were not anxious to
recover their independence; they had lost the taste for it with
their defeat. Their ambition was quite the reverse: they
wished to be allowed to become Romans. Up till then,
however, that proud and greedy aristocracy, who held
power, and who meant to use the human race for the
benefit of their pleasures or their grandeur, had obstinately
refused to raise them to a level with themselves, no doubt
in order to preserve the right of treating them according to
their caprice. In overthrowing the aristocracy, Caesar overthrew
the barrier that closed Rome to the rest of the nations.
The empire made the entire world Roman; it reconciled,
says a poet, and blended under one name, all the nations of
the universe. These are surely great things, and it does not
become us to forget them, us the sons of the vanquished, called
by Caesar to partake in his victory. But who, in Cicero’s
time, thought it would be thus? who could foresee and indicate
these remote consequences? The question did not
present itself then as it does to us who study it from a distance.
Caesar does not anywhere allege the interest of the
conquered among the reasons he gives for his enterprise.
The senate never claimed to be the representative of the
Roman nationality, threatened by an invasion of the barbarians,
and it does not appear that the provinces rose in
favour of him who came to defend them; on the contrary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>they were almost equally divided between the two rivals. If
the West fought on Caesar’s side, all the East repaired to
Pompey’s camp, which proves that when the struggle commenced
its consequences were unknown even to those who
were to profit by them, and whose interest should have
made them clear-sighted. Besides, even if Cicero had suspected
the benefits that the world was going to draw from
Caesar’s triumph, can we think that this reason would have
sufficed to decide him? He was not one of those whose love
for the whole of humanity excuses them from serving their
country. He would have resigned himself with difficulty to
the sacrifice of his liberty, under the pretence that this
sacrifice would profit the Gauls, the Britons, and the
Sarmatians. No doubt he was not indifferent to the interest
of the world, but that of Rome touched him closer. His
temper was gentle and humane, he had written in beautiful
works that all nations are only one and the same family, he
had made himself loved in the province he had governed;
nevertheless, when Caesar opened the city and even the
senate to the strangers who accompanied him, he showed
himself very discontented, and attacked these barbarians
with his most cruel raillery. He saw plainly that those
Spaniards and Gauls who were walking proudly about the
Forum were triumphing over Rome. His Roman pride revolted
at this sight, and I see no reason to blame him for it.
If he could divine or even catch a glimpse of the general
emancipation of the conquered nations which was preparing,
he understood also that this emancipation would bring with
it the loss of the original, distinct, and independent existence
of his country. It was natural that a Roman should not
wish to pay this price even for the prosperity of the world.</p>

<p class='c014'>Putting aside this reason, another, specious if not true,
was much used to entice the irresolute. They were told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>that the republic and liberty were not interested in the war,
that it was simply a struggle between two ambitious men
who were contending for power. In this assertion there
was a certain amount of truth capable of misleading
thoughtless minds. Personal questions certainly held a
large place in this contest. The soldiers of Caesar fought
solely for him, and Pompey had in his suite many friends
and creatures whom thirty years of prosperity and power
had gained for him. Cicero himself gives us to understand,
several times, that it was his old friendship for Pompey
that led him into his camp. “It is to him and to him alone
that I sacrifice myself,” said he, when he was preparing to
leave Italy.<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a> There are moments in which he seems to take
pleasure in limiting the subject of this quarrel he is about to
engage in, and when, writing to his friends, he repeats to them
what Caesar’s partisans said—“It is a conflict of ambition,
<i><span lang="la">regnandi contentio est</span></i>.”<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a> But we must be careful when
reading his correspondence of this period, and must read
it with caution. Never was he more irresolute. He
changes his opinion every day, he attacks and defends all
parties, so that by skilfully putting together all the words
let fall in this discontent and uncertainty, one may find in
his letters grounds for charges against everybody. These
are only the sallies of a restless and frightened mind, of
which we must not make too much use either against others
or against himself. Here, for instance, when he asserts that
the republic has nothing to do in the contest, he does not
say what he really thinks. It is only one of those pretexts
that he invents to justify his hesitation in his friends’
eyes and his own. So rare is it to be quite sincere, I do
not say with others only but with oneself! We are so
ingenious in proving to ourselves that we have a thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>reasons for doing what we do without reason, or through
interest or caprice! But when Cicero wishes to be frank,
when he has no motive to delude himself or deceive others,
he speaks in another manner. Then the cause of Pompey
becomes really that of justice and right, that of honest men
and of liberty. Without doubt, Pompey had rendered very
indifferent services to the republic before being led by
circumstances to defend it. He could not be trusted
entirely, and his ambition was to be feared. In his camp
he affected the airs of a sovereign; he had his flatterers
and his ministers. “He is a little Sulla,” said Cicero,
“who dreams also of proscriptions, <i><span lang="la">sullaturit, proscripturit</span></i>.”<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
The republican party would certainly have taken another
defender if it had been free to choose; but at the time
when Caesar assembled his troops, this party, which had
neither soldiers nor generals, was really forced to accept
Pompey’s aid. It accepted it as that of an ally whom one
distrusts and watches, who, perhaps, will become an enemy
after the victory, but with whom one cannot dispense during
the fight. Besides, although Pompey might not altogether
secure liberty, it was known that it ran fewer risks with him
than with Caesar. He was ambitious doubtless, but more
ambitious of honours than of power. Twice he had been
seen to arrive at the gates of Rome with an army. The
democracy called him, to make himself king, he had only
to will it, and twice he had disbanded his troops and
laid down the fasces. He had been made sole consul, that
is to say, almost dictator, and at the end of six months he
had voluntarily taken a colleague. These precedents made
sincere republicans believe that after the victory he would
content himself with sonorous titles and pompous eulogies,
and that his services would be repaid, without danger to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>any one, with laurels and the purple. In any case, if he
had demanded something else, we may be certain that he
would have been refused, and that he would have found
adversaries in the greater number of those who had become
his allies. There were in his camp many persons who were
not his friends, and who cannot be suspected of having
taken arms to win a throne for him. Cato distrusted him,
and had always opposed him. Brutus, whose father he
had killed, hated him. The aristocracy did not pardon
him for having restored the power of the tribunes, and for
having united with Caesar against it. Is it likely that all
these eminent persons, experienced in affairs, were the
dupes of this indifferent politician who never deceived
anybody, and that, without knowing it, they worked for him
alone? or must we admit, which is still less likely, that they
knew it, and that they voluntarily abandoned their country,
risked their fortunes, and gave their lives to serve the
interests and the ambition of a man whom they did not
love? Assuredly, for them, something else was in question.
When they went over sea, when they decided, notwithstanding
their repugnance, to begin a civil war, when they
came to put themselves under the orders of a general
against whom they had so many reasons for ill-will, they
did not intend to intervene solely in a personal quarrel, but
to come to the help of the republic and of that liberty
which were threatened. “But here,” people say, “you are
deceived again. These names, liberty and republic, delude
you. It was not liberty that was defended in Pompey’s
camp, it was the oppression of the people by a caste.
They wished to maintain the privileges of a burdensome
and unjust aristocracy. They fought to preserve for it the
right to oppress the plebs, and to crush the world.” At
that rate the friends of liberty ought to keep for Caesar the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>sympathies they generally accord to Pompey, for he is the
liberal and the democrat, the man of the people, the successor
of the Gracchi and of Marius. This is indeed the part he
assumed from the day when, almost a child, he had braved
Sulla. Praetor and consul, he had appeared to serve the
popular cause with devotion, and at the moment when he
marched on Rome, abandoned by the senate, he still said,
“I come to deliver the Roman people from a faction that
oppresses it.”<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>How much truth is there in this pretence that he makes
of being the defender of the democracy? What ought to
be thought of it, I do not say by a patrician, who naturally
thought much ill of the people, but by an enemy of the
nobility, by a new man like Cicero? Whatever anger the
disdain of the aristocracy had caused to Cicero, whatever
impatience he had felt at always finding in his way, in his
candidatures, one of those nobles to whom “<em>honours came
while they slept</em>,” I do not find that his ill-humour had
ever led him to pretend that the people was oppressed;<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
and I suppose that when it was asserted before him that
Caesar took up arms to restore him his liberty, he asked
how long it was since he had lost it, and what new privileges
they wished to add to those he already possessed?
He called to mind that the people possessed a legal
organization, had their own magistrates to whom they
appealed from the decisions of others, magistrates inviolable
and sacred, whom the law armed with the enormous power
of staying the action of the government by their interference,
and of interrupting political life; that they had the liberty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>speech and of the rostrum, the right of voting, in which
they trafficked for a living, and finally, free access to all
grades of the magistracy, and he had only to cite his own
case to demonstrate that it was possible for a man without
birth and almost without fortune to attain even the consulship.
Such success in truth was rare. The equality laid
down in the law disappeared in practice. The consular
records of that period contain scarcely any but illustrious
names. A few great families seem to have established
themselves in the highest dignities of the state; they
guarded the avenues to them, and allowed no one to
approach; but was it necessary, in order to break down
the obstacles that the cleverness of a few ambitious men
opposed to the regular working of the institutions, to destroy
these institutions themselves? was the evil so great that it
was necessary to have recourse to the radical remedy of
absolute power? Was it impossible to think that it would
be more surely cured by liberty than by despotism? Had
it not been seen by recent examples that a strong current
of popular opinion was sufficient to overturn all this
aristocratic resistance? The laws gave the people the
means of recovering their influence if they willed it
energetically. With the liberty of voting and of speaking
in the public assembly, with the intervention of the tribunes
and the invincible strength of numbers, they must always
end in being masters. It was their own fault if they left
the power to others, and they deserved the degradation in
which the nobility held them, since they made no effort to
free themselves. Cicero had small esteem for the common
people of his time; he thought them careless and apathetic
by nature. “They demand nothing,” said he, “they desire
nothing”;<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> and every time he saw them stirring in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Forum he suspected that the liberality of some ambitious
men had worked this miracle. He was not, therefore, led
to think it necessary to accord them new rights when he
saw them use their ancient rights so little or so ill, and so
he did not regard the pretext put forth by Caesar for
taking up arms as serious. He never consented to look
upon him as the successor of the Gracchi coming to
emancipate the oppressed plebs; the war which was
preparing never seemed to him to be the renewal of the
ancient struggles between the people and the aristocracy, of
which Roman history is full. In fact, an assembly of ruined
nobles, like Dolabella, Antony, and Curio, marching under
the leadership of him who boasted of being the son of the
gods and of kings, little deserved the name of the popular
party, and there was something else at stake than the
defence of the privileges of birth in a camp to which so many
knights and plebeians had repaired, and which reckoned
among its chiefs Varro, Cicero, and Cato, that is to say,
two burgesses of small fortune of Arpinum and Reate, and
the descendant of the peasant of Tusculum.</p>

<p class='c014'>Caesar, however, does not seem to have been very much
prepossessed with this part of champion of the democracy.
We do not find, on reading his memoirs, that he speaks
very much of the people’s interests. The phrase just
quoted is almost the only one in which they are mentioned.
Elsewhere he is more frank. At the beginning of the civil
war, when he set forth his reasons for commencing it,
he complained that he was refused the consulship, that his
province was taken from him, that he was torn from his
army; he says not a word of the people, of their unrecognized
rights, of their crushed liberty. This was,
however, the moment to speak of them in order to justify
an enterprise that so many people, and those the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>honest, condemned. What did he demand in the final
conditions he laid before the senate before marching on
Rome? His consulship, his army, his province; he defended
his personal interests, he bargained for himself, it
never came into his mind to demand any guarantee for that
people whose defender he called himself. Around him, in
his camp, one thought no more of the people than they did
of themselves. His best friends, his bravest generals, had
no pretension to be reformers or democrats. They did not
think, in following him, that they were going to give liberty
to their fellow-citizens; they wished to avenge their outraged
chief, and to win power for him. “We are the
soldiers of Caesar,” said they with Curio.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> They had no
other title, they knew no other name. When some one
came to speak to those old centurions who had seen
Germany and Britain, who had taken Alesia and Gergovia,
of abandoning Caesar and passing over to the side of the
laws and the republic, they did not reply that they were
defending the people and their rights. “We,” said they,
“shall we quit our general who has given all of us our
ranks, shall we take arms against an army in which we
have served and been victorious for thirty-six years? We
will never do it!”<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> These men were no longer citizens
but soldiers. After thirty-six years of victories, they had
lost the traditions of civil life and the taste for it; the rights
of the people had become indifferent to them, and for them
glory took the place of liberty. Cicero and his friends
thought that these surroundings were not those of a popular
chief who came to restore liberty to his fellow-citizens, but
those of an ambitious man who came to establish absolute
power by arms, and they were not mistaken. Caesar’s
conduct after the war proves this more than all the rest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>How did he use his victory? What benefits did he
confer on the people whose interests he pretended to
defend? I do not speak of what he was able to do for
their comfort and their pleasures, the sumptuous feasts,
the public meals that he gave, the corn and oil that he so
generously distributed to the poorest, the 400 sesterces
(£3 4<em>s.</em>) that he paid each citizen on the day of his
triumph: if these alms satisfied the plebeians of that time,
if they consented to sacrifice their liberty at that price, I
pardon Cicero for not having more esteem for them, and for
not putting himself on their side; but if they demanded
something else, if they wished for a more complete independence,
for a larger share in the affairs of their country,
for new political rights, they did not obtain them, and
Caesar’s victory, notwithstanding his promises, rendered
them neither freer nor more powerful. Caesar humiliated
the aristocracy, but only for his own advantage. He took
the executive power out of the hands of the senate, but
only to put it in his own. He established equality between
all the orders, but it was an equality of servitude, and all
were henceforth reduced to the same level of obedience.</p>

<p class='c014'>I know that after he had silenced the public speakers,
deprived the people of the right of voting, and united in
himself all public authority, the senate that he had
appointed, having exhausted flattery, solemnly awarded to
him the name of Liberator, and voted the erection of a
Temple of Liberty. If it is against this liberty that Cicero
and his friends are accused of having taken up arms, I do not
think it is worth the trouble to defend them from this charge.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us call things by their real name. It was for himself
and not for the people that Caesar worked, and Cicero, in
opposing him, thought he was defending the republic and
not the privileges of the aristocracy.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>But did this republic deserve to be defended? Was
there any hope of preserving it? Was it not manifest that
its ruin was inevitable? This is the greatest charge
that is made against those who followed Pompey’s party.
I admit it is not easy to answer it. The evil that Rome
suffered, and which showed itself in those disorders and
that violence of which Cicero’s letters give us such a sad
picture, was not of a kind to be averted by a few wise
reforms. It was ancient and profound. It became worse
every day without any law being able to prevent or arrest
it. Could one hope to cure it with those slight changes that
the boldest proposed? Of what use was it to diminish,
as was wished, the privileges of the aristocracy and to
augment the rights of the plebeians? The sources
of public life themselves were seriously impaired. The
evil came from the way in which the citizenship was
acquired.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a long time Rome had drawn her strength from the
country people. It was from the rustic tribes, the most
honoured of all, that those valiant soldiers who had conquered
Italy and subdued Carthage had come; but this
agricultural and warlike people, who had so well defended
the republic, could not defend themselves against the
encroachments of the great estates. Enclosed little by little
by those immense domains where cultivation is easiest, the
poor peasant had for a long time struggled against misery
and the usurers; then, discouraged in the struggle, he had
ended by selling his field to his rich neighbour, who coveted
it to round off his estate. He had tried then to become a
tenant farmer, a metayer, a hired labourer on the property
where he had been for so long the master, but there he met
with the competition of the slave, a more frugal worker,
who did not stand out for his wages, who did not make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>terms, who might be treated as one liked.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a> Thus, driven
twice from his fields, both as owner and as tenant farmer,
without work or resources, he had been forced to migrate to
the city. At Rome, however, life was not more easy for
him. What could he do there? There was little trade,
and usually it was not in the hands of the free men. In
countries where slavery flourishes, work is looked down
upon. To die of hunger without doing anything, is regarded
by the free man as a privilege and an honour.
Besides, each noble had men of all trades among his slaves,
and as such a number of workmen were too many for
himself alone, he hired them out to those who had none, or
made them keep shop in a corner of his house for his own
profit. Here again slave competition killed free labour.
Happily at this time Marius opened the ranks of the
army to the poorest citizens (<i><span lang="la">capite censi</span></i>). These unfortunate
men, finding no other resource, became soldiers.
For lack of something better to do, they achieved the conquest
of the world, subjugated Africa, Gaul, and the East,
visited Britain and Germany, and the greater number of
them, the bravest and best, were killed in these distant
expeditions. During this time, the vacancies left in the
city by those who departed and did not return were ill
filled. Since Rome had become powerful, people from all
parts of the world came to her, and we may well suppose
they were not always the most respectable.</p>

<p class='c014'>Several times she had endeavoured to defend herself
against these invasions of foreigners; but it was useless to
make severe laws to remove them, they always returned to
hide themselves in that immense city without a police, and,
once settled there, the more prosperous, by means of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>money, the others by means of base services or cunning,
succeeded in obtaining the title of citizens. Those who
received it more naturally, and without needing to demand
it, were the freedmen. No doubt the law did not grant
them all political rights at once; but after one or two
generations all these reservations disappeared, and the
grandson of him who had ground at the mill and who had
been sold in the slave-market voted the laws and elected
the consuls like a Roman of the old stock. It was of this
mixture of freedmen and foreigners, that was formed what
at this time was called the Roman people, a wretched
people who lived on the bounty of private persons or the
alms of the state, who had neither memories nor traditions,
nor political capacity, nor national character, nor even
morality, for they were ignorant of that which makes up the
honour and dignity of life in the lower classes, namely,
work. With such a people a republic was no longer
possible. This is, of all governments, that which demands
the greatest integrity and political judgment in those who
enjoy it. The more privileges it confers the more devotedness
and intelligence it demands. People who did not use
their rights, or only used them to sell them, were not worthy
to preserve them. That absolute power which they had
invited by their votes, which they had received with applause,
was made for them; and one understands that the historian
who studies from afar the events of the past, when he sees
liberty disappear from Rome, consoles himself for its fall
by saying that it was deserved and inevitable, and that he
pardons or even applauds the man who, in overturning it,
was only an instrument of necessity or justice.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the men who lived then, who were attached to the
republican government by tradition and memories, who
recalled the great things it had done, who owed to it their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>dignities, position, and renown, could they think like us and
resign themselves as easily to its fall? Firstly, this government
existed. They were familiarized to its defects, since
they had lived with them so long. They suffered less from
them, through the long habit of enduring them. On the
other hand, they did not know what this new power that
wished to replace the republic would be. Royalty inspired
the Romans with an instinctive repugnance, especially since
they had conquered the East. They had found there,
under this name, the most odious of governments, the most
complete slavery in the midst of the most refined civilization,
all the pleasures of luxury and the arts, the finest expansion
of intellect with the heaviest and basest tyranny; princes
accustomed to play with the fortune, honour, and life of
men, a species of cruel spoilt children, such as are only now
to be found in the African deserts. This picture did not
attract them, and whatever disadvantages the republic had,
they asked themselves if it was worth while to exchange them
for those that royalty might have. Besides, it was natural that
the fall of the republic should not appear to them so near
and so sure as it does to us. It is with states as with men,
for whom we find, after their death, a thousand causes of
death which nobody suspected during their life-time. While
the machinery of this ancient government was still working
it could not be seen how disorganized it was. Cicero has,
sometimes, moments of profound despair, in which he
announces to his friends that all is lost; but these moments
do not last, and he quickly regains his courage. It seems to
him that a firm hand, an eloquent voice, and the agreement
of good citizens can repair all, and that liberty will easily
remedy the abuses and faults of liberty. He never perceives
the whole gravity of danger. In the worst days, his thoughts
never go beyond the schemers and the ambitious men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>who disturb the public repose; it is always Catiline, Caesar,
or Clodius whom he accuses, and he thinks that all will be
saved if one can succeed in overcoming them. He was mistaken,
Catiline and Clodius were only the symptoms of a
deeper evil that could not be cured; but is he to be blamed
for entertaining this hope, chimerical as it was? Is he to
be blamed for having thought that there were other means
of saving the republic than the sacrifice of liberty? An
honest man and a good citizen ought not to accept these
counsels of despair at first. It is useless to tell him that
the decrees of destiny condemn to perish the constitution
that he prefers and that he has promised to defend, he
does well not to believe it entirely lost until it is actually
overthrown. We may call such men, if we like, blind or
dupes; it is honourable in them not to be too perspicacious,
and there are errors and illusions that are worth more than a
too easy resignation. Real liberty existed no longer at Rome,
as I believe, the shadow only remained, but the shadow was
still something. One cannot bear a grudge against those
who attached themselves to it and made desperate efforts
not to allow it to perish, for this shadow, this semblance,
consoled them for lost liberty and gave them some hope of
regaining it. This is what honest men like Cicero thought,
who, after mature reflection, without enthusiasm, without
passion, and even without hope, went to find Pompey again;
this is what Lucan makes Cato say in those admirable lines
which seem to me to express the feelings of all those who,
without concealing from themselves the sad state of the
republic, persisted in defending it to the last: “As a father
who has just lost his child takes pleasure in conducting his
obsequies, lights with his own hands the funeral pyre, leaves
it with regret, as tardily as he can; so, Rome, I will not
forsake thee until that I have held thee dead in my arms.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>I will follow to the end thy very name, O Liberty, even
when thou shalt be no more than a vain shadow!”<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c011'>IV.</h4>

<p class='c015'>Pharsalia was not the end of Cicero’s political career, as
he had thought. Events were to lead him back once more
to power and replace him at the head of the republic. His
retired life, his silence during the early days of Caesar’s
dictatorship, far from injuring his reputation, on the contrary
enhanced it. Statesmen do not lose so much as they
think by remaining for a time outside of affairs. Retirement,
supported with dignity, increases their importance.
That they are no longer in power suffices for people to find
some inclination to regret them. There are fewer reasons
to be severe towards them when their place is not coveted,
and as people no longer suffer from their faults the memory
of them is easily lost, and their good qualities only are
remembered. This is what happened to Cicero. His disgrace
disarmed all the enemies that his power had made
him, and his popularity was never so great as when he kept
himself voluntarily from the public eye. A little later,
when he thought he ought to draw nearer to Caesar, he
conducted himself with so much tact, he adjusted so
cleverly submission and independence, he knew so well
how to preserve an appearance of opposition even in his
eulogies and flatteries, that public opinion did not cease to
favour him. Besides, the most illustrious defenders of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>vanquished cause, Pompey, Cato, Scipio, Bibulus, were dead.
Of all those who had occupied with honour the highest
posts under the old government, he alone remained; consequently
it was usual to regard him as the last representative
of the republic. We know that on the Ides of
March, Brutus and his friends, after having struck down
Caesar, while brandishing their bloody swords, called for
Cicero. They seemed to recognize him as the head of
their party, and to give him the credit of the bloodshed that
they had just committed.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was, then, circumstances rather than his own will
that caused him to play so great a part in the events which
followed the death of Caesar.</p>

<p class='c014'>I shall narrate later<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a> how he was led to engage in that
struggle with Antony, in which he was to perish. I shall
show that it was not of himself and voluntarily that he
began it. He had quitted Rome and did not wish to
return. He thought that the time for resistance under
legal forms had passed, that it was necessary to oppose to
Antony’s veterans good soldiers rather than good reasons,
and he was not wrong. Convinced that his part was
finished, and that that of the men of war was about to
begin, he set out for Greece, when a gale cast him on the
coast of Rhegium. Thence he repaired to the port of
Velia, where he found Brutus, who was also preparing to
leave Italy, and it was he who, always scrupulous, always
the enemy of violence, asked him to make once again an
effort to rouse the people, and once more to attempt the
struggle on the basis of law. Cicero yielded to the request
of his friend, and although he had little hope of success,
he hastened to return to Rome there to offer this last battle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>This was the second time that he came, like Amphiaraüs,
“to throw himself alive into the gulf.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Brutus did him a good service that day. The desperate
enterprise in which he engaged him, almost in spite of
himself, could not be useful to the republic, but was
serviceable to Cicero’s glory. This was perhaps the grandest
moment in his political life. In the first place, we have
the pleasure and almost the surprise of finding him firm
and decided. He seems to have freed himself from all
that hesitation that usually troubled his conduct; and besides,
it was scarcely possible to hesitate then, for the
question had never been so clearly stated. At each new
development of events, the parties stood out more clearly.
For the first time, the ambition of Caesar, of which everybody
knew, by rallying round the Roman aristocracy all those
who wished, like it, to preserve the ancient institutions, had
enlarged the limits of this party and modified its programme.
By taking into itself new elements it changed in name as
in character; it became the party of order, the party of
honest men, of the “optimates.” It is thus that Cicero loves
to name it. The meaning of this name was at first rather
vague, after Pharsalia it became more precise. As at this
moment there was no longer any doubt of the intentions of
the conqueror, as he was seen to openly substitute his
authority for that of the senate and people, the party that
resisted him took the name proper to it, and which nobody
could any longer refuse it; it became the republican
party. The struggle was fairly begun between the republic
and despotism. And, that doubt might be still less possible,
despotism after Caesar’s death showed itself to the Romans
under its least disguised and, so to say, most brutal form.
A soldier without political genius, without distinction of
manners, without greatness of soul, at once coarse, debauched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>and cruel, asserted by force his right to the inheritance of
the great dictator. He did not take the trouble to hide
his designs, and neither Cicero nor anybody else could be
deceived any longer. It must have been a great relief to
that mind usually so undecided and uncertain to see the
truth so clearly, to be no longer perplexed by shadows, to
have such a complete confidence in the justice of his cause,
and after so much doubt and obscurity at last to fight in
clear daylight. We feel that his mind is at ease! how much
freer and more lively he is! what ardour there is in this old
man, and what eagerness for the fight! None of the young
men about him show so much decision as he, and he himself
is assuredly younger than when he strove against Catiline
or Clodius. Not only does he begin the struggle resolutely,
but, what is more unusual with him, he pursues it to the end
without giving way. By a strange contrast, the most dangerous
enterprise that he had ever undertaken, and which was
to cost him his life, was precisely that in which he best
resisted his usual fits of discouragement and weakness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Immediately on his return to Rome, while he was still
inspired by the ardour that he had acquired at Velia from
his conversations with Brutus, he went to the senate and
ventured to speak there. The first Philippic, compared
with the others, appears timid and colourless; what courage,
however, did it not need to pronounce it in that unconcerned
city, before those frightened senators, at a few paces from
the furious and threatening Antony, who by his spies heard
all that was said against him! Cicero ended then as he
had begun. Twice, at an interval of thirty-five years, he
raised his voice alone, in the midst of a general silence,
against a dreaded power which would not tolerate resistance.
Courage, like fear, is contagious. The courage that Cicero
showed in his speech awakened that of others. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>freedom of speech surprised at first, then shamed those who
kept silence. Cicero took advantage of this first revival,
which was still rather hesitating, to assemble a few persons
round him and find some defenders of the almost forgotten
republic. Here was the difficulty. There were scarcely any
republicans left, and the most determined had gone to join
Brutus in Greece. All that could be done was to appeal
to the moderates of all parties, to all those whom Antony’s
excesses had shocked. Cicero adjured them to forget their
old enmities and to reunite. “Now,” said he, “there is only
one vessel for all honest men.”<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a> Here we recognize his
usual policy. It is again a coalition that he tries to form
as at the time of his consulship. This part is clearly that
for which he has most taste and which suits him best. By
the pliability of his character and his principles he was fitter
than anybody to reconcile opinions, and the habit he had of
approaching all parties made him not a stranger to any, and
he had friends everywhere. Thus his undertaking appeared
at first to succeed very well. Several of Caesar’s generals
readily listened to him, those especially who thought that,
in the main, they lost less by remaining citizens of a free
state, than by becoming subjects of Antony; and ambitious
subalterns, like Hirtius and Pansa, who, after the master’s
death, did not feel themselves strong enough to aim at the
first place, and who would not be contented with the
second. Unfortunately it was still but a collection of
chiefs without soldiers, and never had there been more
need of soldiers than at that moment. Antony was at
Brundusium, where he was waiting for the legions he had
sent for to Macedonia. Enraged by the unexpected resistance
that he had met with, he proclaimed that he would
avenge himself by pillage and slaughter, and he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>known to be the man to do so. Every one thought that
already he saw his house sacked, his estate parcelled out,
his family proscribed. Fear reigned everywhere, men
trembled, hid themselves and fled. The most courageous
sought on all sides for some one who might be called upon
to defend the republic. No aid was to be hoped for but
from Decimus Brutus, who occupied Cisalpine Gaul with
some legions, or from Sextus Pompey, who was reorganizing
his troops in Sicily, but this aid was distant and doubtful,
and ruin was near and sure. In the midst of this general
panic, the nephew of Caesar, the young Octavius, whom
the jealousy of Antony, and the distrust of the republicans
had up till then kept away, and who impatiently awaited
the opportunity of making himself known, thought that this
opportunity had come. He went through the environs of
Rome calling to arms his uncle’s veterans who were settled
there. His name, his liberality, the promises he lavished
soon brought him soldiers. At Calatia, at Casilinum, he
found three thousand in a few days. Then he addressed
the leaders of the senate, offered them the support of his
veterans, demanding for sole recompense that they would
acknowledge him in the efforts he was about to make to
save them. In such distress there was no means of refusing
this help without which they would perish, and Cicero himself,
who had at first shown some distrust, let himself be
seduced at last by this young man who consulted him,
flattered him, and called him father. When, thanks to him,
they had been saved, when they saw Antony, abandoned
by some of his legions, obliged to leave Rome where
Octavius held him in check, the gratitude of the senate was
as lavish as their fear had been great. The liberator was
loaded with dignities and honours. Cicero, in his eulogies,
raised him much above his uncle; he called him a divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>young man raised up by heaven for the defence of his
country: he stood surety for his patriotism and fidelity;
imprudent words for which Brutus reproached him severely,
and which the event was not long in falsifying!</p>

<p class='c014'>The events that followed are too well known for me to
have need of repeating them. Never had Cicero played a
greater political part than at this moment; never had he
better deserved that name of statesman that his enemies
denied him. For six months he was the soul of the republican
party, which was re-constituted at his call. “It
was I, said he proudly, who gave the signal for this awakening,”<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a>
and he was right in saying so. His voice seemed to
restore some patriotism and some energy to this unconcerned
people. He made them once more applaud those grand
names of country and liberty that the Forum would soon
hear no more. From Rome, the ardour gained the
neighbouring townships, and gradually all Italy was roused.
This, however, was not enough for him, he went still
further to raise up enemies for Antony and defenders
for the republic. He wrote to the proconsuls of the provinces
and to the generals of the armies. From one end
of the world to the other he chid the lukewarm, flattered
the ambitious, and congratulated the energetic. He it
was who incited Brutus, always undecided, to seize Greece.
He applauded the bold stroke of Cassius, which made
him master of Asia; he urged Cornificius to drive Antony’s
soldiers from Africa; he encouraged Decimus Brutus
to resist in Modena. The promises of support that he
invited with so much earnestness arrived from all sides.
Even enemies and traitors dared not openly refuse him
their co-operation. Lepidus and Plancus made emphatic
protestations of fidelity. Pollio wrote to him in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>solemn tone “that he swears to be the enemy of all
tyrants.”<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a> On all sides his friendship is demanded, his
support solicited, men put themselves under his protection.
His Philippics, which, happily, he had not time to revise, are
scattered through the whole world, very nearly as he spoke
them, and with the vivacity of the first sketch, preserve traces
of the interruptions and applause of the people. These
passionate harangues carry everywhere the passion of these
grand popular scenes. They are read in the provinces, they
are devoured in the armies, and from the most distant
countries evidence of the admiration they excite arrives to
Cicero! “Your robe is even more fortunate than our arms,”
says a victorious general to him, and adds, “In you the
consular has conquered the consul.”<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a> “My soldiers are
yours,” wrote another to him.<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a> The credit of all the good
fortune of the republic was attributed to him. It was he who
was congratulated and thanked for all the successes that
were obtained. On the evening that the victory of Modena
was known at Rome, the whole people went to his house
to seek him, conducted him in triumph to the Capitol, and
wished to hear from his own mouth an account of the battle.
“This day,” he wrote to Brutus, “has repaid me for all my
trouble.”<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>This was the last triumph of Cicero and the republic.
Success is sometimes more fatal to coalitions than reverses.
When the common enemy, hatred of whom has united
them, has been conquered, private dissensions break out.
Octavius wished to weaken Antony in order to obtain from
him what he wanted; he did not wish to destroy him. When
he saw him flying towards the Alps, he made overtures to
him, and both together marched on Rome. From that time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>nothing remained for Cicero but “to imitate brave gladiators,
and seek like them to die honourably.”<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a> His death was
courageous, whatever Pollio, who, having betrayed him, had
an interest in calumniating him, may have asserted. I would
rather believe the testimony of Livy, who was not one of his
friends, and who lived at the court of Augustus: “Of all
his misfortunes,” says he, “death is the only one that he bore
like a man.”<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a> This, it must be confessed, was something.
He might have fled, and at one moment he tried to do so.
He wished to set out for Greece, where he would have found
Brutus; but after some days’ sailing with contrary winds,
suffering from the sea, tormented above all by regrets and
sadness, he lost heart for life, and was landed at Gaeta, and
went back to his house at Formiae to die there. He had
often thanked the gale that took him back to Velia, the
first time that he wished to flee to Greece. This it was that
gave him the opportunity to deliver his Philippics. The
storm which drove him ashore at Gaeta has not been less
serviceable to his fame. His death seems to me to redeem
the weaknesses of his life. It is much for a man like him,
who did not boast of being a Cato, to have been so firm at
this terrible moment; the more timid he was by temperament
the more I am touched at finding him so resolute in
dying. Thus, when, in studying his history, I am tempted
to reproach him with his irresolution and weakness, I think
of his end, I see him as Plutarch has so well depicted him,
“his beard and hair dirty, his countenance worn, taking
his chin in his left hand as his manner was, and looking
steadily at his murderers,”<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c013'><sup>[69]</sup></a> and I no longer dare to be
severe. Notwithstanding his defects he was an honest man,
“who loved his country well,” as Augustus himself said on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>day of sincerity and remorse. If he was sometimes too
hesitating and feeble, he always ended by defending what
he regarded as the cause of justice and right, and when that
cause had been for ever conquered, he rendered it the last
service it could claim from its defenders, he honoured it by
his death.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>II<br> <span class='c017'>CICERO’S PRIVATE LIFE</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c011'>I</h4>

<p class='c015'>Those who have read Cicero’s correspondence with
Atticus, and know what place questions of money occupy in
these private communications, will not be surprised that I
begin the study of his private life by endeavouring to
estimate the amount of his fortune. The men of those
days were as much concerned about money as the men of
to-day, and it is perhaps in this that these two periods, which
men have so often taken pleasure in comparing, most
resemble each other.</p>

<p class='c014'>It would be necessary to have at hand the account-books
of Eros, Cicero’s steward, in order to set down with exactness
the expenses of his household. All that we know with
certainty on this subject is, that his father left him a very
moderate fortune only, and that he increased this greatly,
while we cannot say precisely to how much it amounted.
His enemies were in the habit of exaggerating it in order to
throw suspicion on the means by which it had been acquired,
and it is indeed probable that if we knew the total it would
appear to us considerable; but we must take care not to
judge of it according to the ideas of our own time. Wealth
is not an absolute thing; a man is rich or poor according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the position in which he lives, and it is possible that what
would be wealth in one place would scarcely be a competency
elsewhere. Now we know that at Rome wealth
was far from being so evenly distributed as it is among us.
Forty years before the consulship of Cicero, the tribune
Philip said that, in that immense city, there were not two
thousand persons who had a patrimony;<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a> but these possessed
all the public wealth. Crassus asserted that, in order to call
himself rich, it was necessary for a man to be able to support
an army out of his revenues, and we know that he was in a
position to do so without inconvenience. Milo contrived to
get into debt in a few years to the amount of more than
seventy million sesterces (£560,000). Caesar, while still a
private person, expended, at one time, one hundred and
twenty million sesterces (£960,000) in order to make a
present of a new Forum to the Roman people. This outrageous
extravagance implies immense fortunes. In comparison
with these, we can understand that Cicero’s, which
scarcely sufficed for the purchase of a house on the Palatine,
and which the adornment of his Tusculan villa almost
exhausted, must have appeared very moderate.</p>

<p class='c014'>In what manner had he gained it? It is not without
interest to know this in order to reply to the ill-natured
reports that his enemies circulated. He says somewhere
that the means by which a fortune was honestly made at
Rome were commerce, contracting for public works and
farming the taxes;<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c013'><sup>[71]</sup></a> but these means, very convenient for
people in haste to enrich themselves, could only be used by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>those who had no political ambition; they excluded from
public honours, and consequently did not suit a man who
aspired to govern his country. We do not see, either, that
he acted like Pompey, who invested his funds in an important
bank and shared in the profits; at least there remains
no trace in his letters of undertakings of this nature. Nor
could he think of making money out of his works. It was
not the custom then for an author to sell his works to a
bookseller; or rather, the trade of a bookseller, as we understand
it now, scarcely existed. Usually those who wished
to read or possess a book borrowed it of the author or of
his friends, and had it copied by their slaves. When they
had more copyists than they needed for their own use, they
made them work for the public and sold the copies they
did not want; but the author had nothing to do with the
profits they drew from them. And finally, public offices
could not have enriched Cicero; we know that they were
less a means of making money than an occasion of expense
and ruin, either by the price it was sometimes necessary to
pay for them, or by the games and entertainments that were
expected from those who had obtained them. It was only
in the government of provinces that immense gains were
made. It was on these gains that the ambitious nobles
usually counted to repair the waste of their fortunes that
the luxury of their private life and the profusion of their
public life had caused. Now Cicero deprived himself
of this opportunity by yielding to his colleague Antony
the province that, according to custom, he ought to have
governed after his consulship. It has been suspected,
indeed, that he then made with him some bargain by
which he reserved to himself a share in the handsome
profits that he relinquished. If this bargain existed, which
is doubtful, it is certain it was not kept. Antony pillaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>his province, but he pillaged it for himself alone, and Cicero
drew nothing from it. Twelve years later, without having
desired it, he was appointed proconsul of Cilicia. We
know that he remained there only a year, and that, without
doing any illegal act, and while securing the happiness of
his subjects, he contrived to take back two million two
hundred thousand sesterces (£17,600), which gives us an
idea of what might be gained in the provinces when they
were pillaged without scruple. Besides, this money did not
profit Cicero; he lent part of it to Pompey, who did not
return it, and it is probable that the civil war caused him to
lose the rest, since he found himself without means at its
close. We must seek, then, elsewhere for the origin of his
fortune. If he had lived in our days we should have no
trouble in learning whence it came. It would be sufficiently
explained by his ability as an advocate. With an eloquence
such as his, he would not fail now-a-days to enrich himself
quickly at the bar; but at that time there was a law forbidding
orators to accept any fee or present from those for
whom they had pleaded (<i><span lang="la">lex Cincia, de donis et muneribus</span></i>).
Although it was the work of a tribune, who had made it, says
Livy, in the interest of the people,<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c013'><sup>[72]</sup></a> it was at bottom an
aristocratic law. By not allowing the advocate to draw a
legitimate profit from his talent, it kept away from the bar
those who had nothing, and reserved the exercise of this
profession for the rich as a privilege, or rather it prevented
it becoming really a profession. I think, however, that this
law was always very imperfectly obeyed. As it could not
provide against everything, it was scarcely possible for it to
prevent the gratitude of clients finding some ingenious
method to escape its severity. If they were really determined
to pay in some manner for the services which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>had received, it seems to me that the law could only
with difficulty prevent it. In Cicero’s time, they did not
fail to violate it openly. Verres told his friends that he
had divided the money he brought back from Sicily into
three parts; the most considerable was to corrupt his judges,
the second to pay his advocates, and he contented himself
with the third.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c013'><sup>[73]</sup></a> Cicero, who on this occasion laughed at
Verres’ advocate, Hortensius, and at the sphynx that he had
received on account, took care not to imitate him. His
brother affirms that up to the time when he was a candidate
for the consulship he had never asked anything from his
clients.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c013'><sup>[74]</sup></a> Nevertheless, whatever scruples we may suppose
him to have had, it is very difficult to admit that he had
never profited by their good-will. No doubt he refused the
presents that the Sicilians wished to make him when he had
avenged them on Verres; perhaps it would not have been
prudent to accept them after such a notorious trial, which
had drawn all eyes upon him, and made him powerful
enemies; but some years afterwards I see that he allowed
himself to accept the present made him by his friend Papirius
Poetus, for whom he had just pleaded.<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c013'><sup>[75]</sup></a> It consisted
of some fine Greek and Latin books, and Cicero loved
nothing so much as books. I notice also that when he had
need of money, which happened sometimes, he preferred
to apply to rich men whom he had defended. These were
less harsh and more patient creditors to him than others,
and it was natural that he should profit by their influence
after having aided them by his eloquence. He tells us himself
that he bought the house of Crassus with the money of
his friends. Among them, P. Sylla, for whom he had just
pleaded, alone lent him two million sesterces (£16,000).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>When he was attacked for this in the senate, Cicero got out
of it with a joke; which proves that the <i><span lang="la">lex Cincia</span></i> was no
longer much respected, and that those who infringed it had
no great fear of being prosecuted.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c013'><sup>[76]</sup></a> It is very possible, then,
that those nobles whose honour or fortune he had saved,
that those towns or provinces that he had protected against
greedy governors, that those foreign princes whose interests
he had defended in the senate, above all, those rich societies
of farmers of the taxes, through whose hands passed all the
money that the world sent to Rome, and whom he served
so vigorously by his reputation or his eloquence, had often
sought and sometimes found an opportunity of testifying
their gratitude. This generosity appears to us now-a-days so
natural that we should scarcely blame Cicero for not having
always rejected it; but we may be sure that, if he sometimes
thought that he might accept it, he always did so with more
moderation and reserve than the greater number of his
contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c014'>We know one of the most usual forms, and, as it seems,
one of the most legal by which this generosity showed
itself. It was the custom at Rome to pay, after death
and by will, all debts of gratitude and affection contracted
during life. This was a means that offered itself to the
client of discharging his obligations to the advocate who
had defended him, and it does not appear that the <i><span lang="la">lex
Cincia</span></i> threw any obstacle in the way. We have nothing
like it among ourselves. At that time, the father of a family
who had natural heirs might withdraw from his fortune any
amount that he wished, and give his relations, his friends,
and all who had been useful or agreeable to him, a good
share of his estate. This custom had become an abuse.
Fashion and vanity had come to have a large share in it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>A man wished to appear to have many friends by inscribing
the names of many persons in his will, and naturally the
most illustrious were inscribed by preference. Sometimes
people were brought together in it who seldom met anywhere
else, and who must have been surprised to find themselves
there. Cluvius, a rich banker of Puteoli, left his estate to
Cicero and Caesar after Pharsalia.<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c013'><sup>[77]</sup></a> The architect Cyrus
placed among his heirs both Clodius and Cicero, that is to
say, the two persons who most heartily detested each other
in Rome.<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c013'><sup>[78]</sup></a> This architect, no doubt, regarded it as an
honour to have friends among all parties. It even happened
that a man set down in his will people whom he had never
seen. Lucullus augmented his immense wealth by bequests
which unknown persons left him while he governed Asia.
Atticus received a good number of legacies from people
of whom he had never heard, and who only knew him by
reputation. How much more then must a great orator like
Cicero, to whom so many were under obligation, and of
whom all Romans were proud, have been often the object
of this posthumous liberality! We see in his letters that he
was the heir of many persons who do not seem to have held
a large place in his life. In general, the amounts left to him
are not very large. One of the largest is that which he inherited
from his old master the Stoic Diodotus, whom he
had kept at his house till his death.<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c013'><sup>[79]</sup></a> In recompense of
this long-continued affection, Diodotus left him all his savings
as a philosopher and teacher. They amounted to a hundred
thousand sesterces (£800). The union of all these small
legacies no doubt made up a considerable sum. Cicero
himself values it at more than twenty million sesterces
(£160,000).<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c013'><sup>[80]</sup></a> It seems to me, therefore, that there is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>doubt that these legacies, with the presents he may have
received from the gratitude of his clients, were the chief
sources of his wealth.</p>

<p class='c014'>This wealth was composed of property of different kinds.
He possessed, firstly, houses in Rome. Besides that which
he inhabited on the Palatine, and that which he had from
his father at Carinae, he had others in Argiletum and on
the Aventine which brought him in an income of eighty
thousand sesterces (£640).<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c013'><sup>[81]</sup></a> He possessed numerous villas
in Italy. We know of eight very important ones belonging
to him,<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c013'><sup>[82]</sup></a> without reckoning those small houses (<i><span lang="la">diversoria</span></i>)
that the nobles bought along the principal roads to have
somewhere to rest when they went from one domain to
another. He had also sums of money of which he disposed
in different manners, as we see in his correspondence. We
cannot estimate this part of his wealth with exactness; but
according to the practice of the rich Romans of that time,
it may be affirmed that it was not less than his houses or
estates. One day when he is asking Atticus to buy him
some gardens that he wishes, he says to him, in an off-hand
way, that he thinks he may have about six hundred thousand
sesterces (£4800) in his own hands.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c013'><sup>[83]</sup></a> We have here perhaps
one of the most curious differences that distinguish
that state of society from ours. Now-a-days scarcely any but
bankers by profession handle such considerable sums of
money. Our aristocracy has always affected to look down
upon questions of finance. The Roman aristocracy, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>contrary, understood them well, and thought much about
them. Their great wealth was used to further political
ambition, and they did not hesitate to risk a part of it to gain
adherents. The purse of a candidate for public honours was
open to all who could be of use to him. He gave to the
poorest, he lent to others, and sought to form with them
bonds of interest which would attach them to his cause. Success
usually followed those who had put the greatest number
of men under obligations. Cicero, although less rich than the
majority of them, imitated them. In his letters to Atticus
he is almost always writing about bills and dates of maturity,
and we see in them that his money circulated on all sides.
He is in constant business relations, and as we should now
say, has a running account with the greatest personages.
Sometimes he lends to Caesar, and sometimes borrows of
him. Among his numerous debtors are found persons of
all ranks and fortunes, from Pompey to Hermogenes, who
seems to have been a simple freedman. Unfortunately,
counting them all, his creditors are still more numerous.
Notwithstanding the example and advice of Atticus, he ill
understood how to manage his fortune. He constantly had
costly fancies. He would have at any price statues and
pictures to adorn his galleries and give them the appearance
of the gymnasia of Greece. He ruined himself to embellish
his country houses. Generous out of season, we see him
lending to others when he is constrained to borrow for
himself. It is always when he is deepest in debt that he
has the greatest desire to buy some new villa. He does not
hesitate, then, to apply to all the bankers of Rome; he goes
to see Considius, Axius, Vectenus, Vestorius; he would
even try to soften Caecilius, the uncle of his friend Atticus,
if he did not know that he was inflexible. Nevertheless he
bears his troubles with a light heart. The prudent Atticus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>tells him in vain that it is disgraceful to be in debt; but as
he shares this disgrace with a great many people it seems
light, and he is the first to joke about it. One day he told
one of his friends that he was so much in debt that he would
willingly enter into some conspiracy, if any one would receive
him, but that since he had punished Catiline’s he inspired
no confidence in others;<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c013'><sup>[84]</sup></a> and when the first day of the
month arrives, when payments become due, he is content
to shut himself up at Tusculum and leave Eros or Tiro
to argue with the creditors.</p>

<p class='c014'>These embarrassments and troubles, of which his correspondence
is full, make us think, almost in spite of ourselves,
of certain passages in his philosophical works which appear
rather surprising when we compare them with his mode of
living, and which may easily be turned against him. Is it
really this thoughtless prodigal, always ready to spend without
consideration, who exclaimed one day in a tone of conviction
that moves us: “Ye immortal gods, when will men
understand what treasures are found in economy!”<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c013'><sup>[85]</sup></a> How
dared this ardent lover of works of art, this impassioned
friend of magnificence and luxury, how dared he treat as
madmen people who love statues and pictures too well, or
build themselves magnificent houses? He stands self-condemned,
and I do not wish to entirely absolve him; but
while we pronounce on him a severe sentence, let us remember
the times in which he lived, and let us think of his
contemporaries. I will not compare him with the worst
men, his superiority would be too evident; but among those
who are regarded as the most honourable, he still holds one
of the foremost places. He did not owe his wealth to
usury like Brutus and his friends; he did not augment it by
that sordid avarice with which Cato is reproached; he did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>not pillage the provinces like Appius or Cassius; he did
not consent like Hortensius to take his share of this pillage.
We must then acknowledge that, notwithstanding the blame
we may lay upon him, he was more scrupulous and disinterested
in money matters than others. In the main, his
irregularities only injured himself,<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c013'><sup>[86]</sup></a> and if he had too much
taste for ruinous prodigality, at least he did not have
recourse to scandalous gains in order to satisfy it. These
scruples honour him so much the more as they were then
very rare, and few people have passed, without stain, through
that greedy and corrupt society in the midst of which he
lived.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>II.</h4>

<p class='c015'>He does not deserve less praise for having been honourable
and regular in his family life. These were virtues of
which his contemporaries did not set him an example.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is probable that his youth was austere.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c013'><sup>[87]</sup></a> He had
firmly resolved to become a great orator, and that was not
to be done without trouble. We know from himself how
hard the apprenticeship to oratory then was. “To succeed
in it, he tells us, a man must renounce all pleasures, avoid
all amusements, say farewell to recreation, games, entertainments,
and almost to intercourse with one’s friends.”<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c013'><sup>[88]</sup></a> This
was the price he paid for his success. The ambition by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>he was devoured preserved him from the other passions, and
sufficed him. His youth was completely taken up with
study. When once these early years were passed the
danger was less; the habit of work that he had formed,
and the important affairs in which he was engaged might
suffice to preserve him from all dangerous impulses.
Writers who do not like him have vainly tried to find in
his life traces of that licentiousness which was so common
around him. The most ill-disposed, like Dio,<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c013'><sup>[89]</sup></a> banter him
about a clever woman, named Caerellia, whom he somewhere
calls his intimate friend.<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c013'><sup>[90]</sup></a> She was so in fact, and
it appears that she was not wanting in influence over him.
His correspondence with her was preserved and published.
This correspondence was, it is said, rather free in tone, and
seemed at first to give some occasion to the malicious; but
it must be remarked, that Caerellia was much older than
he; that, far from being a cause of dissension in his household,
we only see her intervening to reconcile him with
his wife,<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c013'><sup>[91]</sup></a> in fact that their acquaintance seems to have
begun in a common liking for philosophy;<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c013'><sup>[92]</sup></a> a sedate origin
which does not forebode unpleasing consequences. Caerellia
was a learned lady whose conversation must have been
very pleasing to Cicero. Her age, her education which
was not that of ordinary women, put him at ease with her,
and, as he was naturally quick at repartee, as, once excited
by the animation of conversation, he could not always
govern and restrain his wit, and as, besides, by patriotism
as by taste, he put nothing above that free and daring
gaiety of which Plautus seemed to him the model, it may
have happened that he wrote to her without ceremony
those pleasantries “more spicy than those of the Attic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>writers, and yet truly Roman.”<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c013'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Later, when these rustic
and republican manners were no longer in fashion, when,
under the influence of the gradually developing court life,
the rules of politeness were being refined, and manners
were becoming more ceremonious, the freedom of these
remarks no doubt shocked some fastidious minds, and may
have given rise to ill-natured remarks. For our own part,
of all that correspondence of Cicero which is now lost, the
letters to Caerellia are those perhaps that we most regret.
They would have shown us better than all the rest the
habits of society, and the life of the fashionable world at
that time.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is thought that he was about thirty when he married.
It was towards the end of Sulla’s rule, at the time of his
first oratorical successes. His wife, Terentia, belonged to a
rich and distinguished family. She brought him in dowry,
according to Plutarch,<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c013'><sup>[94]</sup></a> 120,000 drachmae (£4440), and
we see that she possessed houses in Rome, besides a forest
near Tusculum.<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c013'><sup>[95]</sup></a> It was an advantageous marriage for a
young man just beginning political life with more talent
than fortune. Cicero’s correspondence does not give a
very good impression of Terentia. We imagine her as
an economical and orderly, but sharp and disagreeable
housewife, with whom it was difficult to live at ease. She
did not agree very well with her brother-in-law Quintus,
and still less with Pomponia her sister-in-law, who, however,
did not agree with anybody. She had that influence
over her husband that a determined and obstinate woman
always has over a careless and irresolute mind. For a long
time Cicero left her absolute mistress of the household, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>was very glad to shift on to somebody else those occupations
that did not suit him. She was not without influence
on his political life. She advised him to take energetic
measures at the time of the great consulship, and later she
embroiled him with Clodius, from dislike to Clodia, whom
she suspected of wishing to allure him. As no gain came
amiss to her, she succeeded in entangling him in some
financial affairs, that Atticus himself, who was not over
scrupulous, did not think very honourable; but there her
power ended. She seems to have remained a stranger,
and perhaps to have been indifferent to her husband’s
literary glory. In none of Cicero’s works, in which the
names of his daughter, his brother, and his son recur so
frequently, is there any mention of his wife. Terentia had
no influence on his mind. He never confided to her his
private opinions on the most serious affairs of life; he never
admitted her to share in his opinions and beliefs. We
have a curious proof of this in his correspondence. Terentia
was devout, and devout to excess. She consulted soothsayers,
she believed in prodigies, and Cicero did not take
the trouble to cure her of this eccentricity. He seems
even, somewhere, to make a singular distribution of labours
between her and himself; he shows her respectfully serving
the gods, while he is occupied in working for men.<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c013'><sup>[96]</sup></a> Not
only did he not disturb her devotion, but he showed a consideration
for her which surprises us. When he was about
to start for Pompey’s camp, he wrote to her: “At last I
am free from that uneasiness and suffering that I experienced,
and which caused you so much concern. The day
after my departure I recognized the cause. During the
night I threw off pure bile, and felt myself relieved as if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>some god had been my doctor. Evidently it was Apollo
and Aesculapius. I beg you to return thanks to them with
your usual piety and zeal.”<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c013'><sup>[97]</sup></a> This is strange language in
the mouth of that sceptic who wrote the treatise <cite>On the
Nature of the Gods</cite>; but Cicero was, no doubt, one of those
people, like Varro and many others, who while they make
little use themselves of religious practices, think that they
are not bad for the common people and for women. There
has survived a whole book of letters from Cicero to Terentia,
which contains the history of his household. What strikes
one on opening it is that, as we get further on, the letters
become shorter, the last are no more than short notes.
And not only does the length of the letters diminish, but
their tone is no longer the same, and marks of affection
become more and more rare. We may then conclude
that this affection was not of the kind that increases with
time; that common life, which strengthens true personal
unions, enfeebled this one. Instead of being strengthened,
it was worn out by length of time. The earlier letters show
an incredible passion, and this in spite of the fact that
Cicero had been married nearly twenty years; but he was
then very unfortunate, and it seems that misfortune makes
people more tender, and that families feel the need of
drawing closer when heavy blows fall on them. Cicero
had just been condemned to exile. He departed very
sorrowfully from Rome, where he knew that his house was
burnt, his friends persecuted, his family ill-treated. Terentia
had behaved very energetically, she had suffered for her
husband, and suffered with courage. On learning the
manner in which she had been treated, Cicero wrote to
her despairingly: “How wretched I am! And must a
woman so virtuous, so honourable, so gentle, so devoted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>be thus tormented for my sake!”<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c013'><sup>[98]</sup></a> “Be assured, he tells
her elsewhere, that I have nothing dearer than you. At
this moment I think I see you, and cannot restrain my
tears!”<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c013'><sup>[99]</sup></a> He added with still more effusion, “Oh, my
life, I would wish to see you again, and die in your arms!”<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c013'><sup>[100]</sup></a>
The correspondence then ceases for six years. It recommences
at the time Cicero left Rome, to go and govern
Cilicia, but the tone is very much changed. In the single
letter remaining to us of this date, affection is replaced by
business. It has to do with a legacy that had fallen in very
opportunely for Cicero’s fortunes, and of the means of
turning it to the best account. It is true he still calls
Terentia his very dear and much-desired wife, <i><span lang="la">suavissima
atque optatissima</span></i>, but these words have the appearance of
polite phrases. However, he shows a great desire to see
her again, and asks her to come as far as she can and wait
for him.<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c013'><sup>[101]</sup></a> She went as far as Brundusium, and, by a lucky
chance, she entered the town at the same time that her
husband arrived in the harbour; they met and embraced
on the Forum. It was a happy moment for Cicero. He
returned with the title of <i><span lang="la">imperator</span></i> and the hope of a
triumph; he found his family united and joyous. Unfortunately
the civil war was just about to break out. During
his absence parties had broken with each other; they were
about to come to blows, and immediately after his arrival
Cicero was obliged to make choice between them, and to
take his side. This war not only injured his political
position, it was fatal to his private happiness. When the
correspondence recommences, after Pharsalia, it becomes
extremely matter-of-fact. Cicero returns to Italy, and
lands again at Brundusium, no longer triumphant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>happy, but vanquished and desperate. This time he does
not wish to see his wife again, although he never had more
need of consolation. He keeps her at a distance, and
that without much ceremony. “If you come, he tells her,
I do not see how you can be useful to me.”<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c013'><sup>[102]</sup></a> What makes
this answer more cruel is, that, at the same time, he sent
for his daughter, and consoled himself with her conversation.
As to his wife she gets nothing more from him than
short notes, and he has the courage to tell her that he does
not make them longer because he has nothing to say.<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c013'><sup>[103]</sup></a> At
the same time he refers her to Lepta, Trebatius, Atticus,
and Sicca, to learn what decisions he has taken. This
shows clearly enough that she no longer enjoyed his confidence.
The only mark of interest he still gives her is to
ask her, from time to time, to take care of her health, a
superfluous recommendation, since she lived more than a
hundred years! The last letter he addressed to her is just
what a man would write to his steward to give an order.
“I expect to be at Tusculum the 7th or 8th of the month,
he says; be careful to prepare everything. I shall, perhaps,
have several persons with me, and very likely we shall
remain some time. Let the bath be ready, and let nothing
be wanting that is necessary to comfort and health.”<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c013'><sup>[104]</sup></a> A
few months afterwards, the separation which this tone foreshadows,
took place between the couple. Cicero divorced
Terentia after more than thirty years of marriage, and when
they had children and grandchildren.</p>

<p class='c014'>What motives drove him to this disagreeable extremity?
Probably we do not know them all. Terentia’s disagreeable
temper must have often caused those little quarrels in the
household which, repeated continually, end by wearing out
the most steadfast affection. About the time that Cicero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>was recalled from exile, and a very few months after he had
written those passionate letters of which I have spoken, he
said to Atticus: “I have some domestic troubles of which I
cannot write to you,” and added, so that he might be understood:
“My daughter and my brother love me still.”<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c013'><sup>[105]</sup></a> We
must think that he had good reason to complain of his
wife, to leave her thus out of the list of persons by whom he
thought himself loved. It has been suspected that Terentia
was jealous of the affection Cicero showed to his daughter.
This affection was somewhat excessive and so exclusive as
possibly to wound her, and she was not a woman to endure
this without complaint. We may believe that these dissensions
prepared and led up to the divorce, but they were
not the final cause of it. The motive was more prosaic
and vulgar. Cicero justified it by the waste and misuse of
his money by his wife, and several times he accused her of
having ruined him for her own benefit. One of the most
curious characteristics of that age was that the women
appear as much engaged in business and as interested in
speculations as the men. Money is their first care. They
work their estates, invest their funds, lend and borrow.
We find one among Cicero’s creditors, and two among his
debtors. Only, as they could not always appear themselves
in these financial undertakings, they had recourse to some
obliging freedman, or some shady business man, who watched
their interests and profited by their gains. Cicero, in his
speech for Caecina, coming across a character of this sort,
whose business was to devote themselves to the fortune of
women, and often to make their own at their expense,
depicts him in these terms: “There is no man one finds
oftener in ordinary life. He is the flatterer of women, the
advocate of widows, a pettifogging lawyer by profession, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>lover of quarrels, a constant attendant at trials, ignorant
and stupid among men, a clever and learned lawyer among
women, expert in alluring by the appearance of a false zeal
and a hypocritical friendship, eager to render services sometimes
useful but rarely faithful.”<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c013'><sup>[106]</sup></a> He was a marvellous
guide for women tormented with the desire of making a
fortune; so Terentia had one of these men about her, her
freedman, Philotimus, a clever man of business, but not
very scrupulous, who had succeeded at this trade, since he
was rich and himself possessed slaves and freedmen. In
early days Cicero often made use of him, doubtless at the
request of Terentia. It was he who got for him at a low
price some of the property of Milo when he was exiled.
It was a profitable piece of business, but not in very good
taste, and Cicero, who felt it to be so, speaks of it with
some shame. On his departure for Cilicia he left the
administration of part of his property to Philotimus, but
he was not long in repenting of it. Philotimus, like the
steward of a great house, paid less attention to his master’s
interests than to his own. He kept for himself the profits
he had made on the property of Milo, and on Cicero’s
return presented him an account in which he figured as
his creditor for a considerable amount. “He is a marvellous
thief!”<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c013'><sup>[107]</sup></a> said Cicero, in a rage. At this time his
suspicions did not go beyond Philotimus; when he returned
from Pharsalia he saw clearly that Terentia was his
accomplice. “I have found my household affairs, said he
to a friend, in as bad a state as those of the republic.”<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c013'><sup>[108]</sup></a>
The distress in which he found himself at Brundusium
made him distrustful. He looked more closely into his
accounts, a thing that was not usual with him, and it was
not difficult for him to discover that Terentia had often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>deceived him. At one time she had retained sixty thousand
sesterces<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c013'><sup>[109]</sup></a> (£480) out of her daughter’s dowry. This was
a handsome profit, but she was not negligent of small
gains. Her husband caught her one day pocketing two
thousand sesterces (£16) out of a sum he had asked her
for.<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c013'><sup>[110]</sup></a> This rapacity completed the irritation of Cicero,
whom other causes no doubt had soured and hurt for a
long time. He resigned himself to the divorce, but not
without sorrow. We do not break with impunity the
bonds that habit, in the absence of affection, ought to
draw closer. At the moment of separation, after so many
happy days have been passed together, so many ills supported
in common, there must always be some memory
which troubles us. What adds to the sadness of these
painful moments is, that when we wish to withdraw and
isolate ourselves in our sorrow, business people arrive; we
must defend our interests, reckon and discuss with these
people. These discussions, which had never suited Cicero,
made him then suffer more than usual. He said to the
obliging Atticus, when asking him to undertake them for
him: “The wounds are too recent, I could not touch them
without making them bleed.”<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c013'><sup>[111]</sup></a> And as Terentia continued
making difficulties, he wished to put an end to the discussion
by giving her all she asked. “I would rather,” he wrote,
“have cause to complain of her than become discontented
with myself.”<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c013'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>We can well understand that the wags did not fail to
make merry on the subject of this divorce. It was a just
retaliation after all, and Cicero had too often laughed at
others to expect to be spared himself. Unfortunately he
gave them, a short time after, a new opportunity of amusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>themselves at his expense. Notwithstanding his sixty-three
years he thought of marrying again, and he chose a very
young girl, Publilia, whom her father, when dying, confided
to his guardianship. A marriage between guardian and
ward is a real stage marriage, and the guardian generally
has the worst of it. How did it happen that Cicero, with
his experience of the world and of life, allowed himself to
be drawn into this imprudent step? Terentia, who had to
revenge herself, repeated everywhere that he had fallen
violently in love with this young girl; but his secretary,
Tiro, asserted that he had only married her in order to pay
his debts with her fortune, and I think we must believe
Tiro, although it is not usual that, in this kind of marriage,
the elder is also the poorer. As might be foreseen, trouble
was not long in appearing in the household. Publilia, who
was younger than her step-daughter, did not agree with
her, and, it appears, could not conceal her joy when she
died. This was an unpardonable crime in Cicero’s eyes,
and he refused to see her again. It is strange that this
young woman, far from accepting with pleasure the liberty
that he wished to restore to her, made great efforts to
re-enter the house of this old man who divorced her,<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c013'><sup>[113]</sup></a> but
he was inflexible. This time he had had enough of marriage,
and it is said that, when his friend Hirtius came to offer
him the hand of his sister, he refused her, under the
pretence that it is difficult to attend at the same time to a
wife and to philosophy. It was a wise answer, but he
would have done well to have thought of it sooner.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>
  <h4 class='c011'>III.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Cicero had two children by Terentia. His daughter
Tullia was the elder. He had brought her up in his own
way, initiating her into his studies, and giving her the taste
for those intellectual things that he loved so much himself,
and which, it appears, his wife did not care for. “I find
in her,” he said, “my features, my words, my mind;”<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c013'><sup>[114]</sup></a>
accordingly he loved her tenderly. While she was still
very young her father could not refrain from making
allusion in one of his pleadings to the affection he had
for her.<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c013'><sup>[115]</sup></a> This affection, certainly the deepest he ever
felt, was the great anxiety of his life. A sadder fate than
that of this young woman it is impossible to imagine.
Married at thirteen to Piso, then to Crassipes, and separated
from them by death and divorce, she re-married for the
third time while her father was absent governing Cilicia.
Suitors were numerous, even among young men of illustrious
family, and it was not only the renown of the father-in-law
that attracted them, as we might think. He tells us that
they supposed he would return from his government very
rich. By marrying his daughter these young men thought
to make an advantageous match which would allow them
to pay their debts.<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c013'><sup>[116]</sup></a> Among them were the son of the
consul Sulpicius and Tiberius Nero, who was the father of
Tiberius and Drusus. Cicero favoured the latter, who even
went to Cilicia to seek his consent, but his wife and
daughter, to whom on leaving he had given the right of
choosing, decided without him for Cornelius Dolabella.
He was a young man of high family, a friend of Curio, of
Caelius and Antony, who till then had lived like them, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>is to say in risking his reputation and wasting his fortune; he
was, besides, a man of wit and fashion. This husband was not
much to the taste of Atticus; but it seems that Terentia
was gained over by his great name, and perhaps Tullia was
not insensible to his fine manners. At first the marriage
seemed a happy one. Dolabella charmed his mother-in-law
and his wife by his good-nature and kindness. Cicero
himself, who had been at first surprised at the haste with
which the affair had been carried through, thought that his
son-in-law had a good deal of wit and refinement. “For
the rest, he added, we must be resigned.”<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c013'><sup>[117]</sup></a> He referred
to the frivolous and dissipated habits that Dolabella did
not give up notwithstanding his marriage. He had promised
to reform, but kept his promise badly, and, however willingly
Cicero would have shut his eyes to his dissoluteness, ended
by making resignation very difficult. He continued to live
like the youth of that time, making an uproar in the streets
at night under the windows of fashionable women, and his
debaucheries seemed scandalous in a city accustomed to
debauch. He attached himself to a fashionable woman,
celebrated by her amorous adventures, Caecilia Metella,
wife of the consular Lentulus Sphinther. She was the same
woman who afterwards ruined the son of the great tragic
actor Aesopus, that madman who, not knowing what to
invent to ruin himself most quickly, had the strange caprice,
at a dinner that he gave to his mistress, to dissolve and
swallow a pearl worth a million sesterces<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c013'><sup>[118]</sup></a> (£8000). With
a woman like Metella, Dolabella soon squandered his
fortune, he then dissipated his wife’s, and not content with
betraying and ruining her, threatened to divorce her when
she dared to complain. It seems that Tullia loved him
very much, and for a long time resisted those who advised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>a divorce. Cicero blames, somewhere, what he calls his
daughter’s<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c013'><sup>[119]</sup></a> folly, but she had at last to decide for this after
fresh outrages, and leave her husband’s house to return to
her father’s. She was enceinte. The confinement that
followed in these painful circumstances carried her off at
Tusculum at the age of thirty-one.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero was inconsolable for her death, and his grief at
losing her was certainly the greatest of his life. As his
affection for his daughter was well known, letters came to
him from all sides, of the sort that usually console those
only who have no need of consolation. The philosophers,
to whom his name gave credit, tried by their exhortations
to make him support his loss more courageously. Caesar
wrote to him from Spain, where he had just vanquished
Pompey’s sons. The greatest personages of all parties,
Brutus, Lucceius, Dolabella himself, shared his sorrow;
but none of these letters must have touched him more
sensibly than that which he received from one of his old
friends, Sulpicius, the great lawyer, who at that time governed
Greece. Fortunately it has been preserved. It is worthy
of the great man who wrote it and of him to whom it was
addressed. The following passage has often been quoted:
“I must tell you a reflection that has consoled me, perhaps
it will succeed in diminishing your affliction. On my return
from Asia, as I was sailing from Aegina towards Megara, I
began to look at the country surrounding me. Megara
was in front of me, Aegina behind, the Piraeus on the right,
Corinth on the left. Formerly these were very flourishing
cities, now they are but scattered ruins. At this sight I
said to myself: How dare we, poor mortals that we are,
complain of the death of our friends, whose life nature has
made so short, when we see at one glance the mere corpses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>of so many great cities lying around!”<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c013'><sup>[120]</sup></a> The thought is
new and grand. This lesson drawn from the ruins, this
manner of drawing moral ideas from nature, this grave
melancholy mingled with the contemplation of a fine
landscape, are sentiments little known to pagan antiquity.
This passage seems inspired by the spirit of Christianity.
We should say it was written by a man familiar with the
sacred writings, and “who was already sitting, with the
prophet, on the ruins of desolate cities.” This is so true
that Saint Ambrose, wishing to write a letter of condolence,
imitated this one, and it was thought, quite naturally, to be
Christian. Cicero’s reply was not less noble. We see in
it a most touching picture of his sadness and isolation.
After having described the sorrow he felt at the fall of the
republic, he adds: “My daughter at least was left me. I
had a place to which to retire and rest. The charm of her
conversation made me forget my cares and sorrows; but
the dreadful wound I received in losing her has re-opened
in my heart all those wounds that I thought closed.
Formerly I retired into my family to forget the misfortunes
of the state, but can the state now offer me any remedy to
make me forget the misfortunes of my family? I am
obliged to shun, at the same time, both my home and the
Forum, for my home no longer consoles me for the trouble
the republic causes me, and the republic cannot fill the
void that I find in my home.”<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c013'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Tullia’s sad fate, and the grief that her death caused her
father, attract us towards her. When we see her lamented
so much we wish to know her better. Unfortunately, not a
single letter of hers remains in Cicero’s correspondence;
when he lavishes compliments on her mind, we are obliged
to take it upon trust, and a father’s compliments are always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>open to suspicion. From what we know, we can easily
admit that she was an accomplished woman; <i><span lang="la">lectissima
femina</span></i>, is the praise Antony, who did not like her family,
gives her.<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c013'><sup>[122]</sup></a> We should like to know, however, how she bore
the education that her father gave her. We rather mistrust
this sort of education, and we cannot help fearing that Tullia
suffered somewhat from it. The very manner in which her
father bewailed her is, to our way of thinking, prejudicial
to her memory. In composing on her death, that treatise
“On Consolation” which was filled with her praises, he has
not, perhaps, done her a great service. A young woman so
unfortunate deserved an elegy; a philosophic treatise seems
to weigh on her memory. Is it not possible that her father
rather spoilt her in wishing to make her too learned? It
was quite the custom at that time. Hortensius had made
his daughter an orator, and it is asserted that, one day, she
pleaded an important case better than a good advocate. I
suspect that Cicero wished to make his a philosopher, and I
am afraid he succeeded only too well. Philosophy presents
many dangers for a woman, and Madame de Sévigné had
not much reason to congratulate herself on having put her
daughter under the system of Descartes. That dry and
pedantic figure is not calculated to make us like women
philosophers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Philosophy succeeded still less with Cicero’s son Marcus
than with his daughter. His father was completely mistaken
about his tastes and abilities, which is not very extraordinary,
for parental tenderness is often more warm than enlightened.
Marcus had only the instincts of a soldier, Cicero wished to
make him a philosopher and an orator, but he lost his
labour. These instincts, repressed for a moment, always
broke out again with added force. At eighteen, Marcus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>lived like all the young men of that time, and it was
necessary to remonstrate with him on his expenditure. He
was bored with the lessons of his master, Dionysius, and
with the rhetoric that his father tried to teach him. He wished
to set out for the Spanish war with Caesar. Instead of
listening to him, Cicero sent him to Athens to finish his
education. He had an establishment like a nobleman’s son.
They gave him freedmen and slaves that he might make as
good a figure as the young Bibulus, Acidinus and Messala
who studied with him. About a hundred thousand sesterces
(£800) were assigned to him for his annual expenses, which
seems a reasonable allowance for a student in philosophy;
but Marcus went away in a bad humour, and his stay at
Athens did not have the results that Cicero expected. No
longer under his father’s eyes he indulged his tastes without
restraint. Instead of following the lectures of the rhetoricians
and philosophers, his time was taken up with good dinners
and noisy entertainments. His life was so much the more
dissolute as, to all appearance, he was encouraged in his
dissipation by his master himself, the rhetorician Gorgias.
This rhetorician was a thorough Greek, that is to say, a man
ready to do anything to make his fortune. In studying his
pupil he saw that he should gain more by flattering his vices
than by cultivating his good qualities, and he accordingly
flattered his vices. In this school, Marcus, instead of paying
attention to Plato and Aristotle, as his father recommended
him, acquired the taste for Falernian and Chian wine, a
taste that continued with him. The only reputation that he
was proud of afterwards was that of being the hardest
drinker of his time; he sought and obtained the glory of
conquering the triumvir Antony, who enjoyed a great reputation
in this line, that he was very proud of. This was his
way of avenging his father, whom Antony had put to death.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Later, Augustus, who wished to pay the son the debt he had
contracted with his father, made him a consul, but did not
succeed in breaking him of his habits of debauchery, for
the sole exploit that we are told of him is, that one day,
when he was drunk, he threw his glass at Agrippa’s head.<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c013'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>We can understand what sorrow Cicero must have felt
when he learnt of his son’s early dissoluteness. I suppose
he hesitated to believe it for a long time, for he liked to
delude himself about his children. So when Marcus,
lectured by all the family, dismissed Gorgias and promised
to behave better, his father, who was very willing to be
deceived, was eager to believe it. From this time we see
him constantly engaged in begging Atticus not to let his son
want for anything, and in studying the letters he receives
from him to try and discover some progress. There
remains just one of these letters of Marcus of the time when
he seems to return to better habits. It was addressed to
Tiro, and is full of protestations of repentance. He acknowledges
himself so humiliated, so tormented by all his faults,
“that not only his soul detests them, but he cannot bear to
hear of them.” To convince him thoroughly of his sincerity
he draws the picture of his life; it is impossible to imagine
one better occupied. He passes his days and almost his
nights with the philosopher Cratippus, who treats him like a
son. He keeps him to dinner in order to deprive himself of
his society as little as possible. He is so charmed with the
learned conversation of Bruttius that he wishes to have him
near him, and pays his board and lodging. He declaims in
Latin, he declaims in Greek with the most learned rhetoricians.
He only visits well-informed men; he only sees
learned old men, the wise Epicrates, the venerable Leonidas,
all the Areopagus in fact, and this edifying narration ends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>with these words: “Above all, take care to keep in good
health, that we may be able to talk science and philosophy
together.”<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c013'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>It is a very pleasing letter, but in reading it a certain
suspicion comes into our mind. These protestations are so
exaggerated that we suspect Marcus had some design in
making them, especially when we remember that Tiro
possessed the confidence of his master, and disposed of all
his liberalities. Who knows if these regrets and high-sounding
promises did not precede and excuse some appeal
for funds?</p>

<p class='c014'>It must be said in favour of Marcus that, after having
grieved his father by his dissipation, at least he consoled
his last moments. When Brutus passed through Athens,
calling to arms the young Romans who were there, Marcus
felt his soldierly instincts revive. He remembered that at
seventeen he had successfully commanded a cavalry corps
at Pharsalia, and he was one of the first to respond to the
call of Brutus. He was one of his most skilful, most
devoted and most courageous lieutenants, and often deserved
his praise. “I am so pleased,” wrote Brutus to
Cicero, “with the valour, activity and energy of Marcus, that
he seems always to recall to me the father whose son he has
the honour to be.”<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c013'><sup>[125]</sup></a> We can well understand how pleased
Cicero must have been with this testimony. It was while
rejoicing over this awakening of his son that he wrote and
dedicated to him his treatise <cite>De Officiis</cite>, which is perhaps
his finest work, and which was his last farewell to his family
and his country.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>
  <h4 class='c011'>IV.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This study of Cicero’s family life is not yet complete;
there remain a few details to add. We know that a Roman
family was not only composed of the persons united by
relationship, but that it also comprised the slaves. Servant
and master were then more closely connected than they are
now, and they had more community of life. In order to
know Cicero thoroughly, then, in his family, we must say a
few words about his relations with his slaves.</p>

<p class='c014'>In theory, he did not hold opinions upon slavery different
from those of his time. Like Aristotle, he accepted the
institution, and thought it legitimate. While proclaiming
that a man has duties to fulfil towards his slaves, he did not
hesitate to admit that they must be held down by cruelty
when there was no other means of managing them;<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c013'><sup>[126]</sup></a> but in
practice he treated them with great mildness. He attached
himself to them so far as to weep for them when he had
the misfortune to lose them. This, probably, was not
usual, for we see that he almost begs pardon for it
of his friend Atticus. “My mind is quite troubled, he
writes to him; I have lost a young man named Sositheus,
who was my reader, and I am more grieved perhaps than I
ought to be at the death of a slave.”<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c013'><sup>[127]</sup></a> I only see one, in
all his correspondence, with whom he seems to be very
angry; this was a certain Dionysius whom he sought for even
in the depths of Illyria, and whom he wished to have again
at any price;<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c013'><sup>[128]</sup></a> but Dionysius had stolen some of his books,
and this was a crime that Cicero could not forgive. His slaves
also loved him very much. He boasts of the fidelity they
showed towards him in his misfortunes, and we know that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>at the last moment they would have died for him if he had
not prevented them.</p>

<p class='c014'>We know better than the rest one of them, who had a
greater share in his affection, namely, Tiro. The name he
bears is Latin, which makes us suspect that he was one of
those slaves born in the master’s house (<i><span lang="la">vernae</span></i>), who were
looked upon as belonging to the family more than the rest,
because they had never left it. Cicero became attached to
him early, and had him carefully instructed. Perhaps he
even took the trouble to finish his education himself. He
calls himself, somewhere, his teacher, and likes to rally him
about his way of writing. He had a very lively affection
for him, and at last could not do without him. He played
a great part in Cicero’s house, and his powers were very
various. He represented in it order and economy, which
were not the ordinary qualities of his master. He was the
confidential man through whose hands all financial matters
passed. On the first of the month he undertook to scold
the debtors who were in arrears, and to get too pressing
creditors to have patience; he revised the accounts of the
steward Eros, which were not always correct; he went to
see the obliging bankers whose credit supported Cicero in
moments of difficulty. Every time there was some delicate
commission to be executed he was applied to, as for instance
when it was a question of demanding some money of
Dolabella without displeasing him too much. The care he
gave to the most important affairs did not prevent him
being employed on the smallest. He was sent to overlook
the gardens, spur on the workmen, superintend the building
operations: the dining-room, even, fell within his province,
and I see that he is entrusted with the sending out the
invitations to a dinner, a thing not always without its
difficulties, for one must only bring together guests who are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>mutually agreeable, “and Tertia will not come if Publius is
invited.”<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c013'><sup>[129]</sup></a> But it is as secretary, especially, that he rendered
Cicero the greatest services. He wrote almost as quickly
as one speaks, and he alone could read his master’s writing,
that the copyists could not decipher. He was more than a
secretary for him, he was a confidant, and even a collaborator.
Aulus Gellius asserts that he helped him in the
composition of his works,<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c013'><sup>[130]</sup></a> and the correspondence does not
belie this opinion. One day when Tiro had remained ill in
some country house, Cicero wrote to him that Pompey, who
was then on a visit to him, asked him to read him something,
and that he had answered that all was mute in the
house when Tiro was not there. “My literature,” he added,
“or rather ours, languishes in your absence. Come back as
quickly as possible to re-animate our muses.”<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c013'><sup>[131]</sup></a> At this time
Tiro was still a slave. It was not till much later, about the
year 700, that he was manumitted. Every one about Cicero
applauded this just recompense for so many faithful services.
Quintus, who was then in Gaul, wrote expressly to his
brother to thank him for having given him a new friend.
In the sequel, Tiro bought a small field, no doubt out of
his master’s bounty, and Marcus, in the letter he wrote him
from Athens, rallies him pleasantly on the new tastes this
acquisition will develop in him. “Now you are a landowner!”
says he, “you must leave the elegance of the town
and become quite a Roman peasant. How much pleasure
I have in contemplating you from here under your new
aspect! I think I see you buying agricultural implements,
talking with the farmer, or saving seeds for your
garden in a fold of your robe at dessert!”<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c013'><sup>[132]</sup></a> But, proprietor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>and freedman, Tiro was no less at his master’s service than
when he was a slave.</p>

<p class='c014'>His health was poor, and not always sufficiently attended
to. Everybody liked him, but under this pretext everybody
made him work. They seemed to agree in abusing
his good-nature, which they knew to be inexhaustible.
Quintus, Atticus, and Marcus insisted upon his constantly
giving them news of Rome and of Cicero. Tiro so readily
took his share of each addition to the business that came
upon his master, that at last he fell ill. He fatigued himself
so much during Cicero’s governorship of Cilicia that, on
the return journey, he had to be left at Patras. Cicero very
much regretted the separation from him, and to testify the
sorrow he felt at leaving him, he wrote to him as often as
three times in the same day. The care that Cicero took on
every occasion of this delicate and precious health was
extreme; he became a doctor in order to cure him. One
day, when he had left him indisposed at Tusculum, he
wrote to him: “Take care of your health, which you have
heretofore neglected in order to serve me. You know what
it demands: a good digestion, no fatigue, moderate exercise,
amusement, and keeping the body open. Come back a
good-looking fellow, I shall like you all the better for it,
you and Tusculum.”<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c013'><sup>[133]</sup></a> When the illness was graver the
advice was given at greater length. All the family joined
in writing, and Cicero, who held the pen, said to him, in
the name of his wife and children: “If you love us all,
and particularly me who have brought you up, you will only
think of re-establishing your health.... I beg you not to
regard expense. I have written to Curius to give you all
that you want, and to pay the doctor liberally that he may
be more attentive. You have rendered me numberless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>services at home, at the Forum, at Rome, in my province,
in my public and private affairs, in my studies and my
literary work; but you will put the finishing touch if, as I
hope, I see you again in good health.”<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c013'><sup>[134]</sup></a> Tiro repaid this
affection by an indefatigable devotedness. With his feeble
health, he lived more than a hundred years, and we may
say that all this long life was employed in his master’s
service. His zeal did not flag when he had lost him, and
his time was taken up with him to his last moments. He
wrote his biography, he brought out his unpublished works;
that nothing should be lost, he collected his smallest notes
and witty sayings, of which, it is said, he made a somewhat
too large collection, for his admiration did not allow him
to distinguish, and he published some excellent editions of
his speeches, which were still consulted in the time of Aulus
Gellius.<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c013'><sup>[135]</sup></a> These assuredly were services for which Cicero,
who thought so much of his literary glory, would have most
heartily thanked his faithful freedman.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is one reflection that we cannot help making when
we study the relations of Tiro with his master, and that is,
that ancient slavery, looked at from this point of view, and
in the house of such a man as Cicero, appears less repulsive.
It was evidently much softened at this time, and letters
have a large share in this improvement. They had diffused
a new virtue among those who loved them, one whose
name often recurs in Cicero’s philosophical works, namely,
humanity, that is to say, that culture of mind that softens
the heart. It was by its influence that slavery, without
being attacked in principle, was profoundly modified in its
effects. This change came about noiselessly. People did
not try to run counter to dominant prejudices; up to
Seneca’s time they did not insist on establishing the right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>of the slave to be reckoned among men, and he continued
to be excluded from the grand theories that were made
upon human brotherhood; but in reality no one profited
more than he by the softening of manners. We have just
seen how Cicero treated his slaves, and he was not exceptional.
Atticus acted like him, and this humanity had
become a sort of point of honour, on which this society of
polished and lettered people prided themselves. A few
years later, Pliny the younger, who also belonged to this
society, speaks with a touching sadness of the sickness
and death of his slaves. “I know well, he says, that
many others only regard this kind of misfortune as a simple
loss of goods, and in thinking thus they consider themselves
great and wise men. For myself, I do not know if they
are as great and wise as they imagine, but I do know that
they are not men.”<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c013'><sup>[136]</sup></a> These were the sentiments of all the
distinguished society of that time. Slavery, then, had lost
much of its harshness towards the end of the Roman republic
and in the early times of the empire. This improvement,
which is usually referred to Christianity, was much
older than it, and we must give the credit of it to philosophy
and letters.</p>

<p class='c014'>Besides the freedmen and slaves, who formed part of the
family of a rich Roman, there were other persons who were
attached to it, although less closely, namely, the clients.
Doubtless the ancient institution of clientage had lost
much of its grave and sacred character. The time had
gone by when Cato said that the clients should take precedence
of kinsmen and neighbours in the house, and that
the title of patron came immediately after that of father.
These ties were much slackened,<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c013'><sup>[137]</sup></a> and the obligations they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>imposed had become much less rigid. Almost the only one
still respected was the necessity the clients were under of
going to salute the patron early in the morning. Quintus,
in the very curious letter that he addressed to his brother
on the subject of his candidature for the consulship, divides
them into three classes: first, those who content themselves
with the morning visit; these are, in general, lukewarm
friends or inquisitive observers who come to learn the news,
or who even sometimes visit all the candidates that they
may have the pleasure of reading in their faces the state of
their hopes; then, those who accompany their patron to
the Forum and form his train while he takes two or three
turns in the basilica, that everybody may see that it is a
man of importance who arrives; and lastly, those who do
not leave him all the time he is out of doors, and who
conduct him back to his house as they had gone to meet
him there. These are the faithful and devoted followers,
who do not haggle about the time they give, and whose
unwearied zeal obtains for the candidate the dignities he
desires.<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c013'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>When a man had the good fortune to belong to a great
family, he possessed by inheritance a ready-made clientage.
A Claudius or a Cornelius, even before he had taken the
trouble to oblige anybody, was sure to find his hall half
filled every morning with people whom gratitude attached
to his family, and he produced a sensation in the Forum by
the number of those who accompanied him the day he went
there to plead his first cause. Cicero had not this advantage;
but, although he owed his clients to himself
alone, they were none the less very numerous. In that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>time of exciting struggles, when the quietest citizens were
exposed every day to the most unreasonable accusations,
many people were forced to have recourse to him to defend
them. He did so readily, for he had no other means of
making a clientage than by giving his services to a great
many. It was this, perhaps, that made him accept so many
bad cases. As he arrived at the Forum almost alone, without
that train of persons whom he had obliged, which gave
public importance, it was necessary for him not to be too
particular in order to form and increase it. Whatever repugnance
his honest mind may have felt on taking up a
doubtful case, his vanity could not resist the pleasure of
adding another person to the multitude of those who accompanied
him. There were, in this crowd, according to
his brother, citizens of every age, rank, and fortune. Important
personages no doubt were mingled with those
insignificant folks who usually formed this kind of retinue.
Speaking of a tribune of the people, Memmius Gemellus,
the protector of Lucretius, he calls him his client.<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c013'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>It was not only at Rome that he had clients and persons
who were under obligation to him; we see by his correspondence
that his protection extended much further, and
that people wrote to him from all parts demanding his
services. The Romans were then scattered over the entire
world; after having conquered it they busied themselves in
making the greatest possible profit out of it. In the track of
the legions and almost at their heels, a swarm of clever and
enterprising men settled on the just conquered provinces to
seek their fortunes there; they knew how to adapt their
skill to the resources and needs of each country. In Sicily
and in Gaul they cultivated vast estates, and speculated in
wines and corn; in Asia, where there were so many cities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>opulent or involved in debt, they became bankers, that is
to say, they furnished them, by their usury, a prompt and
sure means of ruining themselves. In general, they thought
of returning to Rome as soon as their fortune was made,
and in order to return the sooner, they sought to enrich
themselves as quickly as possible. As they were only
encamped, and not really settled in the conquered countries,
as they found themselves there without ties of affection and
without root, they treated them without mercy and made
themselves detested. They were often prosecuted before
the tribunals and had great need of being defended, and
so they sought to procure the support of the best advocates,
above all that of Cicero, the greatest orator of his time.
His talent and his credit were not too great to extricate them
from the discreditable affairs in which they were mixed up.</p>

<p class='c014'>If we wish to become well acquainted with one of those
great merchants of Rome, who, by their character and their
fate, sometimes resemble the speculators of our days, we
must read the speech that Cicero delivered in defence of
Rabirius Postumus. He there narrates the whole story of
his client. It is a lively story, and it is not without interest
to sum it up in order to know what those Roman business
men, who so often had recourse to his eloquence, were like.
Rabirius, the son of a rich and acute farmer of taxes, was
born with the spirit of enterprise. He did not confine himself
to a single branch of commerce, for he was one of those
of whom Cicero said that they knew all the roads by which
money could come in, <i><span lang="la">omnes vias pecuniae norunt</span></i>.<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c013'><sup>[140]</sup></a> He
transacted all kinds of business, and with equally good
fortune; he undertook much himself, and often shared in
the enterprises of others. He farmed the public taxes; he
lent to private persons, to the provinces and to kings. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>generous as he was rich, he made his friends profit by his
good fortune. He created employment for them, gave
them an interest in his business, and a share in the profits.</p>

<p class='c014'>His popularity therefore was very great at Rome; but,
as sometimes happens, his prosperity ruined him. He
had lent a good deal of money to Ptolemy Auletes, King
of Egypt, who probably gave him good interest. This king
having got himself expelled by his subjects, Rabirius was
induced to make him fresh advances in order to recover
the money that was at stake. He pledged his own fortune
and even that of his friends to provide for his expenses; he
defrayed the cost of the magnificent royal <i><span lang="fr">cortège</span></i> when
Ptolemy went to Rome to demand the support of the
senate, and, what must have cost him still more, gave him
the means of gaining over the most influential senators.
Ptolemy’s business appeared safe. As people hoped much
from the gratitude of the king, the most important personages
strove for the honour or rather the profit of reinstating
him. Lentulus, then proconsul of Cilicia, contended that
they could not refuse it to him; but at the same time
Pompey, who received the young prince at his house at
Alba, demanded it for himself. This rivalry caused everything
to miscarry. The opposing interests counteracted
each other, and in order not to cause jealousy by letting
one man profit by this fortunate opportunity, the senate
would not grant it to anybody. It is said that Rabirius,
who knew the Romans well, then gave the king the bold
advice to apply to one of those adventurers of whom Rome
was full and who flinched from nothing for money. A
former tribune, Gabinius, governed Syria. He was promised
10,000 talents (£2,200,000) if he would openly disobey
the decree of the senate. It was a large sum; Gabinius
accepted the bargain, and his troops brought Ptolemy back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>to Alexandria. As soon as Rabirius knew that he was
re-established he hastened to meet him. To make more
sure of recovering his money, he consented to become his
overseer of the revenue (<em>diaecetes</em>), or as we should now say,
his minister of finance. He wore the Greek mantle, to the
great scandal of strict Romans, and put on the insignia
of his office. He had only accepted it with the idea that
he should never be better paid than if he paid himself,
through his own hands. This is what he tried to do, and
it appears that in raising the money promised to Gabinius
he also cautiously took enough to repay himself; but the
people, who were being ruined, complained, and the king,
to whom Rabirius had become intolerable now that he had
no longer need of him, and who was no doubt delighted
to find a convenient means of getting rid of a creditor, threw
him into prison and even threatened his life. Rabirius fled
from Egypt as soon as he could, happy to have left only
his fortune there. He had only one resource left. At the
same time that he administered the king’s finances, he had
bought on his own account Egyptian merchandise, paper,
flax, glass, and had laden several vessels which unloaded
at Puteoli with considerable ostentation. The report of
this reached Rome, and, as people there were used to the
lucky adventures of Rabirius, rumour took pleasure in exaggerating
the number of the vessels and the value of their
cargo. It was even said, in an undertone, that there was
among these ships a smaller one that was not shown, no
doubt because it was full of gold and precious objects.
Unfortunately for Rabirius there was no truth in all these
tales. The little ship only existed in the imagination of
news-mongers, and the goods that the others carried being
sold at a loss, he was quite ruined. His disaster made a
sensation at Rome, and was the talk of a whole season.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>The friends he had so generously obliged deserted him;
public opinion, which up to that time had been so favourable
to him, turned against him. The most indulgent called
him a fool, the most violent accused him of feigning poverty
and of withholding a part of his fortune from his creditors.
It is certain, however, that he had nothing, and only lived
on the bounty of Caesar, one of that small number who
remained true to him in his misfortune. Cicero did not
forget him either. He remembered that, at the time of his
exile, Rabirius had put his fortune at his disposal and paid
men to accompany him, and therefore he hastened to plead
for him when it was proposed to include him in the prosecution
of Gabinius, and he succeeded at least in preserving
his honour and liberty.</p>

<p class='c014'>One trait is missing in this description. Cicero tells us
in his speech that Rabirius was only moderately educated.
He had done so many things in his life that he had not had
time to think of learning, but this was not usual; we know
that many of his colleagues, notwithstanding their not very
literary occupations, were none the less witty and lettered
men. Cicero, recommending a merchant of Thespiae to
Sulpicius, tells him: “He has a taste for our studies.”<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c013'><sup>[141]</sup></a>
He looked upon Curius of Patras as one of those who had
best preserved the turn of the ancient Roman humour.
“Make haste and come back to Rome, he wrote him,
lest the seed of our native humour be lost.”<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c013'><sup>[142]</sup></a> Those
knights who associated themselves in powerful companies
and farmed the taxes, were also men of wit and men of the
best society. Cicero, who came from their ranks, had connection
with almost all of them; but it seems that he was
more especially connected with the company that farmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the pasturages of Asia, and he says that it put itself under
his protection.</p>

<p class='c014'>This protection was also extended to people who were
not Romans by birth. Foreigners, we can well understand,
regarded it as a great honour and security to be in any way
connected with an illustrious personage in Rome. They
could not be his clients, they wished to become his hosts.
At a time when there were so few convenient hotels in the
countries one passed through, it was necessary, when you
wished to travel, to have obliging friends who would consent
to receive you. In Italy, rich people bought little houses
where they passed the night on the roads they were accustomed
to travel; but, elsewhere, they journeyed from one
host to another. To shelter a rich Roman in this way was
often a heavy expense. He always had a large train with
him. Cicero tells us that he met P. Vedius in the depths
of Asia “with two chariots, a carriage, a litter, horses,
numerous slaves, and, besides, a monkey on a little car, and
a number of wild asses.”<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c013'><sup>[143]</sup></a> Vedius was a comparatively unknown
Roman. One may judge of the suite that a proconsul
and a praetor had when they went to take possession
of their provinces! However, although their passage exhausted
the house that received them, this ruinous honour
was solicited because numberless advantages were found
in securing their support. Cicero had hosts in all the
great cities of Greece and Asia, and they were almost always
the principal citizens. Kings themselves like Deiotarus
and Ariobarzanes considered themselves honoured by this
title. Important cities, Volaterrae, Atella, Sparta, Paphos
frequently claimed his protection and rewarded it with
public honours. He counted entire provinces, nations
almost, among his clients, and after the affair of Verres, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>instance, he was the defender and patron of Sicily. This
custom survived the republic, and in the time of Tacitus
orators of renown had still among their clients provinces
and kingdoms. It was the only mark of real distinction
that remained to eloquence.</p>

<p class='c014'>These details, it seems to me, complete our knowledge
of what the life of an important person was at that time.
As long as we are satisfied with studying the few persons
who compose what we should now-a-days call his family, and
only see him with his wife and children, his life very much
resembles our own. The sentiments which are the foundation
of human nature have not changed, and they always
lead to very nearly the same results. The cares which
troubled Cicero’s domestic hearth, his joys and misfortunes,
are much like ours; but as soon as we leave this limited
circle, when we replace the Roman among the crowd of
his servants and familiar friends, the difference between
that society and ours becomes manifest. Now-a-days life has
become more plain and simple. We have no longer those
immense riches, those extensive connections, nor that multitude
of people attached to our fortunes. What we call a great
retinue would scarcely have sufficed for one of those clerks
of the farmers of the revenue who went to collect the taxes
in some provincial town. A noble, or even a rich Roman
knight, did not content himself with so little. When we
think of those armies of slaves they gathered together in
their houses and on their estates, of those freedmen who
formed a sort of court around them, of that multitude of
clients who encumbered the streets of Rome through which
they passed, of those hosts they had throughout the world,
of those cities and realms that implored their protection,
we can better understand the authority of their speech, the
haughtiness of their bearing, the breadth of their eloquence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the gravity of their deportment, the feeling of personal
importance which they threw into all their actions and
speeches. It is here, above all, that the perusal of Cicero’s
letters renders us a great service. They give us a notion
of lives lived on a scale such as we no longer know, and
thus help us to understand better the society of that time.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ATTICUS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Of all Cicero’s correspondents, none kept up a longer
or more regular intercourse with him than Atticus. Their
friendly relations lasted without interruption and without
a shadow till their death. They corresponded during the
shortest absences, and, when it was possible, more than once
a day. These letters, sometimes short to communicate a
passing reflection, sometimes long and studied, when events
were graver, playful or serious according to circumstances,
that were written in haste wherever the writers happened to
be, these letters reflect the whole life of the two friends.
Cicero characterized them happily when he said “They
were like a conversation between us two.” Unfortunately,
at present, we hear only one of the speakers and the conversation
has become a monologue. In publishing his friend’s
letters Atticus took good care not to add his own. No
doubt he did not wish his sentiments to be read too openly,
and his prudence sought to withhold from the public the
knowledge of his opinions and the secrets of his private
life; but in vain he sought to hide himself, the voluminous
correspondence that Cicero kept up with him was sufficient
to make him known, and it is easy to form from it an exact
idea of the person to whom it is addressed. This person is
assuredly one of the most curious of an important epoch,
and deserves that we should take the trouble to study him
with some care.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>I.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Atticus was twenty years old when the war between
Marius and Sulla began. He saw its beginnings and
nearly became its victim; the tribune Sulpicius, one of the
chief heads of the popular party, and his relation, was put
to death with his partisans and friends by Sulla’s orders,
and as Atticus often visited him he ran some risk. This
first danger decided his whole life. As, notwithstanding
his age, he had a firm and prudent mind, he did not allow
himself to be discouraged, but reconsidered his position.
If he had had hitherto some slight inclination towards
political ambition, and the idea of seeking public honours,
he gave them up without hesitation when he saw what a
price must sometimes be paid for them. He understood
that a republic, in which power could only be seized by
force, was lost, and that in perishing it was likely to drag
down with it those who had served it. He resolved then
to hold himself aloof from public affairs, and his whole
policy consisted henceforth in creating for himself a safe
position, outside of parties, and out of reach of danger.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sieyès was asked one day: “What did you do during the
Terror?” “What did I do?” he answered; “I lived.” That
was a great thing to do. Atticus did still more, he lived not
only during a terror of a few months, but during a terror of
several years. As if to test his prudence and ability, he was
placed in the most troubled period in history. He looked
on at three civil wars, he saw Rome four times invaded by
different leaders, and the massacres recommence at each
new victory. He lived, not humble, unknown, allowing
himself to be forgotten in some distant town, but at Rome,
and in full publicity. Everything contributed to draw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>attention to him; he was rich, which was a sufficient cause
for being proscribed, he had a great reputation as a man of
wit, he willingly associated with the powerful, and, through
his connections at least, he was regarded as an important
person. Nevertheless, he was able to escape all the dangers
that his position and his wealth created for him, and even
contrived to become greater at each of those revolutions
which, it seemed, might have ruined him. Each change of
government, which hurled his friends from power, left him
richer and stronger, so that at last he found himself placed,
quite naturally, almost on a level with the new master. By
what miracle of cleverness, by what prodigy of skilful combinations
did he succeed in living honoured, rich and
powerful at a time when it was so difficult to live at all? It
was a problem full of difficulties; this is how he solved it.</p>

<p class='c014'>In view of the first massacres of which he had been a
witness, Atticus decided to take no part henceforth in
public affairs and parties; but that is not so easy to do as
one might think, and the firmest resolution does not always
suffice for success. It is useless to declare that you wish
to remain neutral; the world persists in classing you according
to the name you bear, your family traditions, your
personal ties and the earlier manifestations of your preferences.
Atticus understood that, in order to escape this
sort of forced enlistment and to throw public opinion off
the scent, it was necessary to leave Rome, and to leave it
for a long time. He hoped, by this voluntary exile, to regain
full possession of himself and break the ties that, against his
will, still bound him to the past. But, if he wished to withdraw
himself from the eyes of his fellow-citizens, he did not
intend to be forgotten by everybody. He meant to return;
and did not wish to return as a stranger, no longer recognized,
and lose all the benefit of his early friendships. Thus he did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>not choose for his retreat some distant estate, in an unknown
province, or one of those obscure towns on which the eyes of
the Roman people never fell. He retired to Athens, that is to
say, to the only city that had preserved a great renown, and
which still held a place in the admiration of the nations on
a level with Rome. There, by a few well-placed liberalities,
he drew to himself the affection of everybody. He distributed
corn to the citizens, he lent money without interest
to that city of men of letters, the finances of which were
always embarrassed. He did more, he flattered the Athenians
on their most sensitive side. He was the first Roman who
dared openly to declare his taste for the letters and arts of
Greece. Up to that time it had been the fashion among his
countrymen to esteem and cultivate the Greek muses in
private, and to laugh at them in public. Cicero himself, who
on so many occasions braved this stupid prejudice, dared
not appear to know off-hand the name of a great sculptor;
but Cicero was a statesman for whom it was proper to show,
at least now and then, that haughty disdain for other
nations which partly constituted what is called the Roman
dignity. It was necessary to flatter this national weakness if
one wished to please the people. Atticus, who did not
mean to ask anything of them, was more free; so he openly
laughed at these customs. Immediately on his arrival he
began to speak and write Greek, to openly frequent the
studios of sculptors and painters, to buy statues and pictures,
and to compose works on the fine arts. The Athenians
were as much delighted as surprised to see one of their conquerors
partake in their most cherished tastes, and thus
protest against the unjust disdain of the rest. Their gratitude,
which was always very noisy, as we know, overwhelmed
Atticus with all sorts of flattery. Decrees in his honour were
multiplied, he was offered all the dignities of the city; they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>even wished to raise statues to him. Atticus hastened to
refuse everything; but the effect was produced, and the
report of such great popularity did not fail to reach Rome,
carried by those young men of high family who had just
finished their education in Greece. In this manner the reputation
of Atticus lost nothing by his absence; people of taste
talked of this enlightened connoisseur of the arts who had
made himself remarked even at Athens; and during this
same time the politicians, no longer seeing him, lost the
habit of classing him with a political party.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was an important step. There remained a more
important one to take. Atticus had seen betimes that to be
rich is the first condition of independence. This general
truth was even more evident at that time than at any other.
How many people were there whose conduct during the civil
wars can only be explained by the state of their fortunes!
Curio had but one motive for serving Caesar, whom he did
not like, namely, the pressure of his creditors; and Cicero
himself puts among the chief reasons that prevented him
going to Pompey’s camp, whither all his sympathies called
him, the money that Caesar had lent him, and which he
could not repay. To escape embarrassments of this kind
and gain entire liberty, Atticus resolved to become rich, and
became so. It is of importance, I think, to give here a few
details to show how people got rich at Rome. His father
had left him a rather moderate fortune, two million sesterces
(£16,000). When he left Rome he sold almost all the
family property, that he might leave nothing behind to tempt
the proscribers, and bought an estate in Epirus, in that
country of large herds, where the land brought in so much.
It is probable he did not pay much for it. Mithridates
had just ravaged Greece, and, as there was no money,
everything went at a low price. This domain quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>prospered under skilful management; new lands were
bought every year out of the surplus revenue, and Atticus
became one of the great landed proprietors of the country.
But is it likely that his wealth came to him solely through
the good management of his land? He would have willingly
had this believed, in order to resemble somewhat in this
manner Cato and the Romans of the old school. Unluckily
for him, his friend Cicero betrays him. In reading this unreserved
correspondence we are not long in perceiving that
Atticus had many other ways of enriching himself besides
the sale of his corn and herds. This skilful agriculturalist
was at the same time a clever trader, who carried on all
businesses successfully. He excelled in drawing a profit, not
only from the follies of others, which is common, but even
from his own pleasures, and his talent consisted in enriching
himself where others ruin themselves. We know for instance
that he was fond of fine books; then, as now, this was a
very costly fancy, but he knew how to make it a source of
handsome profits. He collected in his house a large
number of skilful copyists whom he trained himself; after
having made them work for him, when his passion was
satisfied he set them to work for others, and sold the books
they copied to the public very dear. He was thus a veritable
publisher for Cicero, and as his friend’s works sold well
it happened that this friendship, which was full of charm
for his heart, was not without use to his fortune.<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c013'><sup>[144]</sup></a> This
commerce might be avowed, and a friend to letters was not
forbidden to become a bookseller; but Atticus engaged as
well in many transactions that ought to have been more
repugnant to him. As he saw the success that everywhere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>attended gladiatorial fights, and that no festival took place
without one of these grand butcheries, he thought of raising
gladiators on his estates. He had them carefully instructed
in the art of dying gracefully, and hired them out at a high
rate to cities that wished to amuse themselves.<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c013'><sup>[145]</sup></a> It must be
acknowledged that this is not a suitable trade for a scholar
and a philosopher; but the profits were large, and the
philosophy of Atticus was accommodating as soon as there
was a good profit to make. Besides, he was a banker when
the opportunity offered, and lent at a high rate of interest,
as the greatest nobles of Rome did without scruple. Only,
he was more circumspect than others, and took care to
appear as little as possible in the affairs that he conducted,
and he had, no doubt, in Italy and Greece, clever agents
who made the most of his capital. His business relations
extended throughout the world; we know of his debtors in
Macedonia, Epirus, Ephesus and Delos, almost everywhere.
He lent to private persons; he lent also to cities, but quite
secretly, for this business was then as little esteemed as it
was lucrative, and persons who took to it were not considered
either honest or scrupulous. So Atticus, who thought as
much of his reputation as of his fortune, would not let
any one know that he conducted this sort of business. He
carefully concealed it even from his friend Cicero, and we
should be ignorant of it now if he had not experienced some
untoward accidents in this risky business. Although usually
great profits were gained, some dangers also were run.
After having suffered the Roman domination for two
centuries, all the cities, allied and municipal, and especially
those of Asia, were completely ruined. They all had less
revenue than debts, and the proconsuls, combined with the
farmers of the taxes, carried off their resources so completely
that there was nothing left for the creditors to take, unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>they exerted themselves. This is what happened once to
Atticus, notwithstanding his activity. We see that Cicero
rallies him in one of his letters about the siege he is going to
lay to Sicyon;<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c013'><sup>[146]</sup></a> this siege was evidently that of some recalcitrant
debtors; Atticus never made any other campaigns;
and, in truth, this one succeeded badly. While he thus
went to war against this unfortunate indebted town, the
senate took pity on it, and protected it by a decree against
its too exacting creditors, so that Atticus, who set out from
Epirus as a conqueror, with flying banners, was reduced,
says Cicero, when he had arrived under the walls, to extract
from the Sicyonians a few poor crowns (<i><span lang="la">nummulorum
aliquid</span></i>) by means of prayers and flatteries.<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c013'><sup>[147]</sup></a> We must,
however, suppose that Atticus was usually more lucky in the
investment of his funds, and by his well-known prudence we
are assured that he knew how to choose more solvent debtors.
All this business that he carried on would certainly soon
have made him very rich; but he had no need to take so
much trouble, for while he was working so skilfully to make
his fortune it came to him ready made from another quarter.
He had an uncle, Q. Caecilius, who passed for the most
terrible usurer of Rome, where there were so many, and
who only consented to lend to his nearest relations, and as a
special favour, at the rate of one per cent. per month. He
was a hard, inflexible man, who had rendered himself so
hateful to everybody that the people could not be prevented
from outraging his corpse on the day of his funeral. Atticus
was the only person who had been able to get on with him.
Caecilius adopted him by will, and left him the greater
part of his property, ten million sesterces, a little more than
£80,000. Henceforth his fortune was made, he was
independent of everybody, and free to follow his own
inclinations.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>But was it not to be feared, that when he was back in
Rome, the resolution that he took to shun all ties would
have a bad look? He could not decently pretend indifference
or fear as a reason for keeping aloof from parties; he
had to find a more honourable motive and one that he
might proclaim; a school of philosophy furnished him with
it. The Epicureans, sacrificing everything to the conveniences
of life, said that it was good to abstain from
public employments to avoid the worry they brought. “Do
not engage in politics,” was their favourite maxim. Atticus
professed to be an Epicurean; henceforth his abstention
had a plausible pretext, fidelity to the opinions of his sect,
and if he was blamed, the blame fell upon the whole school,
which always makes the share of each individual very light.
Was Atticus in reality a veritable and complete Epicurean?
This is a question that the learned discuss, and that the
character of this personage easily permits us to solve. To
suppose that in anything whatever he attached himself
scrupulously to a school, and pledged himself to be a
faithful disciple of it, would be to know him ill. He had
studied them all for the pleasure that this study gave to his
inquisitive mind, but he was determined not to be a slave
to their systems. He had found a principle in the Epicurean
morals that suited him, and seized it in order to justify
his political conduct. As to Epicurus himself and his
doctrine, he cared very little about them, and was ready to
abandon them on the first pretext. Cicero shows this very
pleasantly in a passage of the <cite><span lang="la">De Legibus</span></cite>. He represents
himself in this work chatting with Atticus on the banks of
the Fibrenus, under the delightful shades of Arpinum. As
he wishes to trace back the origin of laws to the gods, it
is necessary for him first to lay down that the gods concern
themselves with men, which the Epicureans denied.
He turns then to his friend, and says: “Do you admit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Pomponius, that the power of the immortal gods, their reason,
their wisdom, or, if you like it better, their providence, rule
the universe? If you do not admit it I must begin by
demonstrating it.—Well then, replies Atticus, I admit it,
if you like, for thanks to these birds that are singing, and to
the murmuring of these brooks, I have no fear that any of
my fellow-disciples may hear me.”<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c013'><sup>[148]</sup></a> Here is a very accommodating
philosopher, and the school will not get very
much good from an adept who abandons it as soon as he
is sure that it will not be known. The character of Atticus
is here well seen. To embrace an opinion resolutely is to
pledge oneself to defend it, and to expose oneself to the
necessity of fighting for it. Now, philosophical quarrels,
although they be not bloody, are no less desperate than
others; this is war all the same, and Atticus wishes for
peace in all things, at least for himself. It is amusing to
examine the part that Cicero gives him in the philosophical
dialogues into which he introduces him. In general he
does not discuss, he incites to discussion. Inquisitive and
insatiable, he asks, he interrogates continually; he compels
a reply, he raises objections, he animates the combatants,
and during this time he quietly enjoys the fight without ever
taking part in it. We shall see, by and by, that this was
exactly the part he took in politics.</p>

<p class='c014'>Atticus remained twenty-three years away from Rome,
only visiting it at long intervals and usually remaining but a
very short time. When he thought that, by his long absence,
he was quite free from the ties that attached him to the
political parties, when he had gained independence with
wealth, when he had secured himself against all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>reproaches that might be made him on his conduct by giving
his prudence the appearance of a philosophical conviction,
he thought of returning definitively to Rome and there
resuming his interrupted course of life. He chose a
moment for returning when all was calm, and, as if to break
entirely with his past, he came back with a new surname,
by which people soon learnt to call him. This name of
Atticus, which he brought back from Athens, seemed to
indicate clearly that he would only live henceforth for the
study of letters and the enjoyment of the arts.</p>

<p class='c014'>From this moment he divided his time between residence
in Rome and in his country houses. He quietly wound up
his banking affairs, some of which were still standing over,
and took measures to hide from the public the sources of
his wealth. He kept only his estates in Epirus and his
houses in Rome, which brought him in a good deal, and
the profits of which he could acknowledge. His property
continued to increase, thanks to the way in which he
managed it. Besides, he had none of those weaknesses
which might have endangered it; he did not care about
buying or building, he did not possess any of those splendid
villas at the gates of Rome or at the sea-side, the keeping
up of which ruined Cicero. He still sometimes lent money,
but, as it appears, rather to oblige than to enrich himself.
He was careful, besides, to choose safe persons, and showed
himself without pity when debts fell due. This he did,
he said, in the interest of his debtors, for, in tolerating their
negligence he would encourage them to ruin themselves.
But he did not stand upon ceremony in dismissing those
with whom his money would have run some risk, even if they
were his nearest relations. Cicero, relating to him one day
that their common nephew, the young Quintus, had come
to him and tried to move him by the picture of his poverty,
added: “I took then something of your eloquence; I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>answered nothing.” It was a good contrivance, and Atticus
must have employed it more than once with regard to his
brother-in-law and his nephew, who were always without
money. He had learnt how to make for himself a high
social position at small cost. He lived in his house on the
Quirinal—which was more spacious and commodious
within than handsome without, and which he repaired as
little as possible—among the works of art that he had
selected in Greece, and the lettered slaves whom he had
carefully trained himself, and whom everybody envied him.
He often assembled the cultivated people of Rome at feasts
where there was a great display of learning. His hospitality
did not cost much, if it is true, as Cornelius Nepos, who
had seen his accounts, asserts, that he only spent 3000
asses (£6) a month on his table.<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c013'><sup>[149]</sup></a> Cicero, always indiscreet,
relates that Atticus often served to his guests very
common vegetables on very costly dishes;<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c013'><sup>[150]</sup></a> but what did
it matter? every one considered himself fortunate in taking
part in these select parties, where they heard Atticus talk
and Cicero’s finest works read before they were published,
and it may be said that all the most distinguished persons
of that great period held it an honour to frequent that house
on the Quirinal.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>II.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Of all the advantages of Atticus, one is most tempted to
envy him his good fortune in attaching to himself so many
friends. He took much trouble to do so. From his arrival
at Rome we see him busied in putting himself on good
terms with everybody, and using every means to please men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>of all parties. His birth, his wealth, and the manner in
which he had acquired it, drew him towards the knights;
these rich farmers of the taxes were his natural friends, and
he soon enjoyed a great reputation among them; but he was
not less connected with the patricians, usually so disdainful
of all who were not of their caste. He had taken the
surest means to conciliate them, which was to flatter their
vanity. He took advantage of his historical knowledge to
manufacture for them agreeable genealogies, in which he
made himself partaker in a good many lies, and supported
their most fanciful pretensions by his learning. This
example shows at once his knowledge of the world, and the
advantage he drew from it when he wished to gain the
friendship of anybody. We can see what a close observer
he must have been, and the talent that he had for seizing
and profiting by the weak side of people, merely by
considering the nature of the services that he rendered to
each person. He had proposed to Cato to undertake the
management of his affairs at Rome during his absence, and
Cato hastened to accept this: a steward of such capacity
was not to be despised by a man who cared so much for
his wealth. He had gratified the vain Pompey, by busying
himself in selecting in Greece some fine statues to ornament
the theatre he was building.<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c013'><sup>[151]</sup></a> As he well knew that Caesar
was not accessible to the same kind of flattery, and that, to
attract him, more real services were necessary, he lent him
money.<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c013'><sup>[152]</sup></a> Naturally, he attached himself by preference to
the heads of parties; but he did not neglect others when
he could serve them. He carefully cultivated Balbus and
Theophanes, the confidants of Caesar and Pompey; he
even went sometimes to visit Clodius and his sister Clodia,
as well as other people of doubtful reputation. Having
neither rigid scruples like Cato, nor violent aversions like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Cicero, he accommodated himself to everybody; his good-nature
lent itself to everything; he suited all ages as well as
all characters. Cornelius Nepos remarks with admiration,
that while yet very young he charmed the old Sulla, and that
when very old he could please the young Brutus. Atticus
formed a common link between all these men who were so
different in temper, rank, opinions, and age. He went continually
from one to the other, as a sort of pacific ambassador,
trying to bring them together and unite them, for it was his
habit, says Cicero, to form friendships between others.<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c013'><sup>[153]</sup></a> He
removed the suspicions and prejudices which prevented
them knowing one another; he inspired them with the
desire to see each other and become intimate, and if, later,
any differences arose between them, he became their intermediary,
and brought about explanations which made them
friends again. His masterpiece in this line is to have
succeeded in reconciling Hortensius and Cicero, and
making them live amicably together notwithstanding the
violent jealousy that separated them. What trouble must
he not have had to calm their irritable vanity, which was
always ready to fly out, and which fate seemed to take pleasure
in exciting still more, by putting them in constant rivalry!</p>

<p class='c014'>All these acquaintanceships of Atticus were certainly not
real friendships. He visited many of these personages only
for the advantage that his safety or his wealth might draw
from them; but there are a great number of others who
were really his friends. To confine ourselves to the most
important, Cicero loved no one so much as he did him;
Brutus showed him an unreserved confidence to the last,
and on the eve of Philippi wrote him his last confidences.
There remain too many striking proofs of these two illustrious
friendships for them to be called in question, and we
must admit that he was able to inspire a lively affection in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>two of the noblest minds of that time. At first we are very
much surprised at this. His prudent reserve, that openly
avowed determination to keep clear of all entanglements in
order to escape all danger, ought, as it seems, to have kept
aloof from him men of conviction who sacrificed fortune and
life for their opinions. By what merit was he nevertheless
able to attach them to himself? How was a man so taken
up with himself and so careful of his interests able to enjoy
so fully the pleasures of friendship, which seem at first sight,
to exact devotedness and self-forgetfulness? How did he
succeed in making the moralists, who assert that egotism is
the death of true affection, belie themselves?<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c013'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>This is still one of those problems of which the life of
Atticus is full, and it is the most difficult to solve. Seen
from a distance, even through the praises of Cicero, Atticus
does not seem attractive, and one would not be tempted to
choose him for a friend. And yet it is certain that those
who lived with him did not judge him as we do. They
loved him, and felt themselves from the first inclined to love
him. That general good-will that he inspired, that determination
of every one to pardon or not to see his defects,
those lively friendships that he called forth, are evidences
that it is impossible to resist, whatever surprise they may
cause us. There was, then, about this personage something
else than we see; he must have possessed a kind of attraction
that is inexplicable to us, which was personal to him,
and which has disappeared with him. For this reason it
is no longer possible for us to understand thoroughly that
strange attraction that he exercised at first sight on all his
contemporaries. We can, however, form some idea of it,
and the writers who knew him, especially Cicero, give a
glimpse of some of those brilliant or solid qualities by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>he gained over those who approached him. I shall enumerate
them according to their testimony, and if they still do not
seem sufficient to justify altogether the number of his friendships
and their ardour, we must join to them in thought
that personal charm that it is impossible now to define or
recover because it vanished with himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Firstly, he had a good deal of cultivation, everybody agrees
about that, and a sort of cultivation especially agreeable to
the society that he frequented. He was not solely one of
those pleasant triflers who charm for a moment on a passing
acquaintance, but who have not the qualifications for a
longer connection. He was a person of many attainments
and solid knowledge; not that he was a man of deep learning,
this title is not a great recommendation in the intercourse
of society; Cicero thought that people like Varro, who are
perfect mines of knowledge, are not always amusing, and
relates that when the latter came to see him at Tusculum
he did not tear his mantle in trying to retain him.<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c013'><sup>[155]</sup></a> But,
without being really a scholar, Atticus had touched on
everything in his studies, the fine arts, poetry, grammar,
philosophy, and history. Upon all these subjects he possessed
just and sometimes original ideas; he could discuss
matters with learned men without too great disadvantage,
and he always had some curious detail to tell those who were
not so. Pascal would have called him a cultivated gentleman
(<i><span lang="la">honnête homme</span></i>); in everything he was an intelligent and
enlightened amateur. Now, for several reasons, the knowledge
that an amateur acquires is of the kind most current
in society. Firstly, as he does not study according to rule,
he interests himself above all in curiosities; he learns by
preference racy and novel details, and it is precisely these
that people of society want to know. Besides, the very
multiplicity of the studies which tempt him, prevents him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>exhausting any; his caprice always carries him off elsewhere
before he has thoroughly examined anything. The result
is that he knows a great many things, and always within the
limits in which it pleases men of the world to know them.
In fact, the characteristic of the amateur is to do everything,
even what he only does for a moment, with enthusiasm.
As it is a personal taste that draws him to his studies, and
as he only continues them as long as they interest him, his
language is more lively when he speaks of them, his tone
freer and more original, and consequently more agreeable,
than that of scholars by profession. Such is the notion we
must form of the learning of Atticus. It was too extensive
for his conversation ever to become monotonous; it was not
deep enough to run the risk of being tedious; it was, in
fine, living, for when things are done with enthusiasm it is
natural to speak of them with interest. This is what made
his conversation so attractive, and this is how he charmed
the most fastidious and least favourably disposed minds. He
was still quite young when the aged Sulla, who had no reason
to like him, met him at Athens. He took so much pleasure
in hearing him read Greek and Latin verses and talk about
literature, that he would not leave him, and wished by all
means to take him back with him to Rome. Long after,
Augustus felt the same charm; he was never tired of hearing
Atticus talk, and when he could not go to see him, he wrote
to him every day simply to receive his answers, and thus to
continue, in some sort, those long conversations with which
he was so delighted.</p>

<p class='c014'>We can imagine, then, that the first time people met this
accomplished man they felt themselves drawn towards him
by the charm of his conversation. In proportion as he was
better known, other and more solid qualities were discovered,
which retained those whom his culture had attracted. In
the first place there was a great security in his intercourse.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Although he was connected with people holding very diverse
opinions, and though, through them, he had the secrets of
all parties, he was never reproached with having betrayed
these to anybody. We cannot see that he ever furnished a
serious cause to any of his friends to keep aloof from him,
or that any of his connections were broken otherwise than by
death. This intercourse, so secure, was at the same time
very easy. No one was ever more indulgent and accommodating.
He took care not to weary by his demands or to repulse
by bluntness. Those storms which so often troubled
the friendship of Cicero and Brutus were not to be feared in
his. It was rather one of those calm and uniform intimacies
which grow stronger from day to day by their regular continuance.
It was this especially that must have charmed
those politicians who were oppressed and fatigued by that
bustling activity which used up their lives. On coming out
of this whirlwind of business, they were happy to find, at a
few paces from the Forum, that peaceful house on the Quirinal
into which outside quarrels did not enter, and to go and
chat for a moment with that even-tempered and accomplished
man who always received them with the same smile,
and in whose good-will they had such a tranquil confidence.</p>

<p class='c014'>But nothing, assuredly, could have won him so many
friends as his readiness to oblige them. This was inexhaustible,
and it could not be asserted that it was interested,
since, contrary to custom, he gave much and demanded nothing.
Here again is one of the reasons why his friendships
were so lasting, for it is always this sort of interchange that
we think we have a right to demand, and the comparisons
that we make, in spite of ourselves, between good offices
which we render and those which we receive, which in
the end disturb the most firm friendships. Atticus, who
knew this well, had so contrived as to have need of nobody.
He was rich, he never had law-suits, he did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>seek public employments, so that a friend who was determined
to recompense the services he had received could
never find the opportunity,<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c013'><sup>[156]</sup></a> and remained always under
obligations to him, and his debt continued to increase, for
Atticus never wearied of being useful. We have an easy
means of appreciating the extent of this serviceableness, to
see it close, and, so to say at work, namely, to rapidly recall
the services of all sorts that he had rendered Cicero during
their long intimacy. Cicero had much need of a friend
like Atticus. He was one of those clever men who cannot
reckon; when his account-books were presented to him he
would gladly have said, like his pupil, Pliny the Younger,
that he was used to another sort of literature: <i><span lang="la">aliis sum
chartis, aliis litteris initiatus</span></i>. Atticus became his man of
business; we know his talent for this profession. He leased
Cicero’s property very dear, saved as much as he could out
of the income and paid the most pressing debts. When
he discovered new ones, he dared to scold his friend, who
hastened to reply very humbly that he would be more careful
for the future. Atticus, who did not much believe this,
set to work to make up the deficit. He went to see the
wealthy Balbus or the other great bankers of Rome with
whom he had business relations. If the calamities of the
times made it difficult to get credit, he did not hesitate to
dip into his own purse. Those who know him will not think
this generosity without merit. When Cicero wished to buy
some estate, Atticus at first would get angry; but if his friend
did not give way, he quickly went to visit it and discuss the
price. If it was a question of building some elegant villa,
Atticus lent his architect, corrected the plans, and overlooked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the work. When the house was built, it had to be adorned,
and Atticus would send to Greece for statues. He excelled
in selecting them, and Cicero was inexhaustible in his praises
of the Hermathenae in Pentelican marble that he had procured
for him. In a villa of Cicero, we can well understand
that the library was not forgotten, and it was from Atticus
again that the books came. He traded in them, and kept
the handsomest for his friend. The books being bought, it
was necessary to arrange them, so Atticus sent his librarian
Tyrannion with his workmen, who painted the shelves,
pasted together the detached leaves of papyrus, put the labels
on the rolls, and arranged the whole in such good order that
Cicero, enchanted, wrote: “Since Tyrannion has arranged
my books one would say that the house has a soul.”<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c013'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>But Atticus did not stop at these services, which we
might call external; he penetrated into the home, he knew
all its secrets. Cicero kept nothing from him, and confided
to him unreservedly all his domestic griefs. He tells him
about the violent temper of his brother and the follies of his
nephew; he consults him on the vexations that his wife and
son cause him. When Tullia was of an age to marry, it was
Atticus who sought her a husband. The one he proposed
was the son of a rich and well-conducted knight. “Return,”
he said sagely to Cicero, “return to your old flock.” Unfortunately
he was not listened to. They preferred to the
rich financier a broken-down nobleman, who squandered
Tullia’s dowry and forced her to leave him. When Tullia
was dead, of grief perhaps, Atticus went to the nurse’s to
visit the little child she had left, and took care that it wanted
for nothing. At the same time Cicero gave him plenty of
occupation with his two divorces. After he had divorced
his first wife, Terentia, it was Atticus whom he charged to
get her to make a will in his favour. It was to him also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>that he gave the disagreeable commission to remove the
second, Publilia, when she was determined to forcibly re-enter
the home of her husband, who would have nothing
more to do with her.</p>

<p class='c014'>These are doubtless great services; he rendered others
still more delicate, still more appreciated. It was to him
that Cicero entrusted what was most dear to him in the
world, his literary glory. He communicated his works to
him as soon as he had written them, he took his advice in
making corrections, and waited for his decision to publish
them. Thus he treated him as a friend with whom one
feels at home, and to whom one unbosoms oneself completely.
Although he was eager that his eloquence should
be taken seriously, when he was sure of being heard by
Atticus only, he made no scruple of joking about himself
and his works. He introduced him without reserve to all
the secrets of the craft, and showed him the receipts for his
most popular effects. “This time, said he gaily, I employed
the whole scent-box of Isocrates, and all the caskets
of the disciples.”<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c013'><sup>[158]</sup></a> Nothing can be more curious than the
way in which he related to him one day, one of his greatest
oratorical successes. It was a question of celebrating the fame
of the great consulship, a subject upon which, as we know,
he was inexhaustible. That day he had a reason for speaking
with more brilliancy than usual. Pompey was present; now
Pompey had the weakness to be jealous of Cicero’s glory.
It was a good opportunity to enrage him, and Cicero took
care not to neglect it. “When my turn came to speak, he
writes to Atticus, immortal gods! what rein I gave myself!
What pleasure I took in loading myself with praises
in the presence of Pompey, who had never heard me extol
my consulship! If I ever called to my aid periods, enthymemes,
metaphors, and all the other figures of rhetoric,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>it was then. I did not speak, I shouted, for it was a
question of my stock subjects, the wisdom of the senate,
the good-will of the knights, the union of all Italy, the
smothered remains of the conspiracy, peace and plenty re-established,
etc. You know my thunders when I speak of
these subjects. They were so fine that day that I have no
need to tell you more about them; you may often have
heard the like at Athens!”<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c013'><sup>[159]</sup></a> It is impossible to quiz oneself
with greater lightheartedness. Atticus repaid these
confidences by the trouble he took for the success of his
friend’s works. As he had seen their birth, and had busied
himself with them before they were known to the public, he
almost regarded himself as their parent. It was he who
took upon himself to start them in the world and make
them succeed. Cicero says that he was admirably well
skilled in this, and it does not surprise us. The means he
most frequently employed to create a good opinion of them,
was to have the finest passages read by his best readers to
the clever men whom he assembled round his table. Cicero,
who knew the usual frugality of his repasts, begged him to
deviate from it a little on these occasions. “Have a care,
he writes to him, to treat your guests well, for if they are
in a bad humour with you, they will vent it on me.”<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c013'><sup>[160]</sup></a> It
was natural that Cicero should be extremely grateful for all
these services; but it would be judging him ill to suppose
that he was only attached to him for the benefits he received
from him. He really loved him, and all his letters are full
of evidences of the most sincere affection. He was always
happy with him; he was never tired of associating with
him; he had scarcely left him than he ardently wished to
see him again. “May I die, he wrote to him, if either
my house at Tusculum, where I feel so comfortable, or the
Isles of the Blest could please me without you!”<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c013'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>pleasure he experienced at being <em>fêted</em>, applauded,
flattered, at having around him an obsequious and admiring
multitude, in the midst of this crowd and noise he always
turned with regret towards his absent friend. “With all
these people, he tells him, I feel myself more alone than
if I had only you.”<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c013'><sup>[162]</sup></a> All these people, in fact, are composed
of political friends who change with circumstances, whom a
common interest brings to you, and a rival ambition takes
away again; with them Cicero is obliged to be reserved and
careful, which is a torture for such an open-hearted nature.
On the other hand, he can tell Atticus everything, and
confide in him without restraint. So he hastens to demand
his presence when the least annoyance happens to him.
“I want you, he writes to him, I have need of you, I am
waiting for you. I have a thousand things that disturb and
vex me, and a single walk with you will relieve me.”<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c013'><sup>[163]</sup></a> We
should never end if we were to collect all those charming
expressions of which the correspondence is full, and in
which his heart plainly speaks. They leave no doubt
about Cicero’s feelings; they prove that he regarded Atticus
not only as one of those steadfast and serious friends on
whose support he could count, but also, which is more
surprising, as a sensitive and tender soul: “You take your
share,” he tells him, “in all the troubles of others.”<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c013'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Here is something far removed from the notion we
usually have of him, and yet we cannot resist such clear
testimony. How can we contend that he had only a
doubtful affection for his friends when we see all his friends
contented with it? Are we to be more exacting than they,
and would it not be wronging men like Brutus and Cicero
to suppose that they had been dupes so long without perceiving
it? On the other hand, how can we explain the
fact that posterity, which only judges by the documents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>that the friends of Atticus have furnished it, draws from
these very documents an opinion quite the reverse of that
held by them? Evidently it is because posterity and contemporaries
do not judge men from the same stand-point.
We have seen that Atticus, who had made a rule not to
engage in public affairs, did not think himself obliged to
partake the dangers that his friends might run, through
having taken part in them. He left them both the
honours and the perils. Sensitive, obliging, devoted to
them in the ordinary business of life, when a great political
crisis occurred that compromised them, he stood aside, and
left them to expose themselves alone. Now, when we look
at the facts from a distance, and are separated from them,
as we are, by several centuries, we only perceive the most
important events, and especially the political revolutions,
that is to say, precisely those circumstances with which the
friendship of Atticus had nothing to do. Hence the severe
judgment we pronounce upon it. But his contemporaries
judged otherwise. Those great crises are, after all, but rare
and passing exceptions; without doubt contemporaries are
much struck by them, but they are still more impressed by
those numberless small incidents which make up every-day
life, and which posterity does not perceive. They judge of a
man’s friendship by those services which are rendered every
moment, and which are important by their mere number,
much more than by any exceptional service which may be
given on one of these great and rare occasions. This
accounts for the fact that they had an opinion of Atticus so
different from ours.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is, beyond doubt, one of the characteristic traits of
this person, that it was a necessity to him to have many
friends, and that he took trouble to attract and retain them.
We may refuse to admit, if we will, that this need was, with
him, the effect of a generous and sympathetic nature, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>it came from what Cicero admirably calls “the impulse of
the soul that desires to love;” but, even supposing that he
only thought of occupying and filling up his life, we must
acknowledge that to fill it up in this manner is not a mark
of a vulgar nature. This refined Epicurean, this master in
the art of living at ease, knew “that life is no longer life if
we cannot repose on the affection of a friend.”<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c013'><sup>[165]</sup></a> He had
given up the excitement of political strife, the triumphs of
eloquence, the joys of satisfied ambition, but, as a compensation,
he was determined to enjoy all the pleasures of
private life. The more he confined and limited himself to
it, the more particular and refined he became with regard
to the pleasures it could give; as he had only left himself
these, he wished to enjoy them fully, to relish them, to live
on them. He needed friends, and among them the greatest
minds, the noblest souls of his time. He expended all that
energy which he did not employ in anything else, in procuring
for himself those pleasures of society that Bossuet calls the
greatest good of human life. Atticus enjoyed this good
even beyond his desires, and friendship generously repaid
him for all the trouble he had taken for it. It was his
single passion; he was able to satisfy it completely, and
friendship, after having adorned his life, has shed a lustre on
his name.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>III.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Atticus appears in a favourable light in private life. He
is less fortunate when we study the course he followed in
public affairs. On this point he has not been spared blame,
and it is not easy to defend him.</p>

<p class='c014'>We should not however be very unfavourable to him if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>we judged his conduct entirely according to the ideas of
our days. Opinion has become less severe now on those
who openly make profession of living apart from politics.
So many men aspire to govern their country, and it has
become so difficult to make choice among this multitude,
that we are tempted to look kindly upon those who have
not this ambition. Far from being blamed, they are called
moderate and wise; they form an exception which is encouraged
in order to lessen the number of aspirants. At
Rome they thought otherwise, and it is not difficult to find
reasons for this difference. There, what we may call the
political body was in reality very circumscribed. Besides
the slaves, who did not count, and the common people, who
contented themselves with giving or rather selling their
votes in the elections, and whose greatest privilege it was
to be entertained at the expense of the candidates, and fed
at the expense of the public treasury, there remained only
a few families of ancient lineage or more recent celebrity
who divided all public employments among themselves.
The aristocracy of birth and of fortune was not very
numerous, and scarcely sufficed to furnish the required
number of officials of all sorts to govern the world. It was
necessary therefore that no one should refuse to take his
part, and to live in retirement was considered a desertion.
It is not the same in our democracy. As all offices are
open to everybody, and as, thanks to the diffusion of
education, men worthy to occupy them may arise in all
ranks, we need no longer fear lest the absence of a few
quiet people, friends of peace and repose, will make a
sensible and regrettable gap in the serried ranks of those
who struggle from all quarters for power. Moreover, we
think now that there are many other ways of serving one’s
country besides public life. Romans of high birth knew
no other; they looked upon commerce as a not very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>honourable means<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c013'><sup>[166]</sup></a> that a private man might employ to
make his fortune, and did not see what the state might
gain by it; literature seemed an agreeable but trivial
pastime, and they did not understand its social importance.
It follows that among them, a man of a certain rank could
only find one honourable mode of employing his activity
and being useful to his country, namely, to fill political
offices.<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c013'><sup>[167]</sup></a> To do anything else was, according to their ideas,
to do nothing; they gave the name of idlers to the most
laborious scholars, and it did not come into their heads
that there was anything worth the trouble of occupying a
citizen’s time beyond the service of the state. All the ancient
Romans thought thus, and they would have experienced a
strange surprise if they had seen any one claim the
right, as Atticus did, not to serve his country within the
limits of his powers and talents. Assuredly Cato, who
never rested, and who, at ninety years of age, bravely
quitted his villa at Tusculum to go and accuse Servius
Galba, the butcher of the Lusitanians, would have thought
that to remain in his house on the Quirinal, or on his estate
in Epirus in the midst of his books and statues, while the
fate of Rome was being decided in the Forum or at
Pharsalia, was to commit the same crime as to remain in
his tent on the day of battle.</p>

<p class='c014'>This systematic abstention of Atticus was not, then, a
Roman custom; he had it from the Greeks. In those
small ungovernable republics of Greece, where they knew
no repose, and which passed constantly and without warning
from the sternest tyranny to the most unbridled licence, we
can understand that quiet and studious men should have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>grown weary of all this sterile agitation, and ceased to desire
public employments which were only obtained by flattering
the capricious multitude, and only kept on condition of
obeying it. Moreover, what value could this power, so
hardly acquired, so seldom preserved, have, when it was
necessary to share it with the most obscure demagogues?
was it really worth while to take so much trouble in
order to become the successor or the colleague of Cleon?
At the same time that weariness and disgust kept honourable
men aloof from these paltry struggles, philosophy, more
studied every day, communicated to its disciples a sort of
pride which led them to the same result. Men who passed
their time in meditating upon God and the world, and who
endeavoured to understand the laws that govern the universe,
did not deign to descend from these heights to
govern states a few leagues square. Thus they constantly
discussed in the schools, whether a man should occupy
himself with public affairs, whether the sage ought to seek
public office, and whether the active or the contemplative
life was the better. A few philosophers hesitatingly gave
the preference to active life, the greater number sustained
the opposite opinion, and under cover of these discussions
many men thought themselves authorized to create a sort
of elegant indolence in voluptuous retreats embellished by
letters and the arts, where they lived happily while Greece
was perishing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Atticus followed their example. Importing this custom
from Greece into Rome, he openly announced his resolution
not to take part in political discussions. He began by
adroitly keeping aloof during all those quarrels that continually
agitated Rome from the time of Cicero’s consulship
to the civil wars. At the very moment when these struggles
were most active he frequented all parties, he had friends on
all sides, and found in these widespread friendships a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>pretext for remaining neutral. Atticus was more than sixty
years old when Caesar passed the Rubicon, an age when
the obligation of military service ceased among the Romans.
This was another reason for remaining quiet, and he did
not fail to use it. “I have taken my discharge,”<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c013'><sup>[168]</sup></a> he
replied to those who wished to enrol him. He held the
same course, and with the same success, after the death of
Caesar; but he then disappointed public opinion still more.
He was so well known to be the friend of Brutus that it was
thought he would not hesitate to take his side this time.
Cicero himself, who ought to have known him, reckoned
upon it; but Atticus was not inconsistent with himself, and
took advantage of an important occasion to let the public
know that he would not be drawn in against his will.
While Brutus was raising an army in Greece, some knights,
his friends, started the idea of raising a subscription
among the richest men of Rome to give him the means of
maintaining his soldiers. They applied at first to Atticus,
whose name they wished to put at the head of the list.
Atticus bluntly refused to subscribe. He answered that
his fortune was at the service of Brutus, if he had need of
it, and asked him as a friend, but he declared at the same
time that he would take no part in a political manifestation,
and his refusal caused the failure of the subscription. At
the same time, true to his habit of flattering all parties,
he welcomed Fulvia, Antony’s wife, as well as Volumnius
the superintendent of his workmen, and, sure of having
friends everywhere, he waited for the result of the struggle
without much fear.</p>

<p class='c014'>The strangest thing is that this man, while so persistent
in remaining neutral, was not indifferent. His biographer
gives him this praise, that he always belonged to
the best party,<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c013'><sup>[169]</sup></a> and that is true; only he made it a rule not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to serve his party; he was contented with giving it his
good wishes. But these good wishes were the warmest
imaginable. He had, though we should scarcely believe
it, political passions which he dared to express in private
with incredible vigour. He hated Caesar so much that he
went as far as to blame Brutus for having permitted his
interment.<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c013'><sup>[170]</sup></a> He would have wished, no doubt, as the most
furious demanded, that his corpse should be thrown into the
Tiber. Thus he did not abstain from having preferences,
and showing them to his most intimate friends. His reserve
only began when it was necessary to act. He never consented
to take part in the struggle; but if he did not share
its danger he felt at least all its excitement. We smile at
seeing him become animated and excited as if he were a
real combatant; he takes his share in all successes and
all reverses, he congratulates the energetic, he entreats
the lukewarm, and even scolds the faltering, and permits
himself to advise and reprimand those who seem to him, who
did not act at all, to act too languidly. It is amusing to
hear the reproaches he addresses to Cicero when he sees
him hesitating to go and join Pompey; he adopts the most
pathetic tone, he reminds him of his actions and his words,
he entreats him in the name of his glory, he quotes his
own words to him to persuade him.<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c013'><sup>[171]</sup></a> This excess of
audacity into which he allows himself to be drawn for
others, sometimes produces rather comic incidents. At
the moment when Pompey had just shut himself up in
Brundusium, Atticus, moved by the most lively grief, wished
for some attempts to be made to save him, and went so
far as to ask Cicero to do some striking action before
leaving. “It only requires a banner,” said he, “every one
will flock to it.”<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c013'><sup>[172]</sup></a> The worthy Cicero felt himself quite
excited by these lively exhortations of his friend, and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>were times when he was tempted to be bold, and when he
only demanded the opportunity to strike a heavy blow.
The opportunity came, and he relates in the following
words how he took advantage of it. “As I arrived at my
house at Pompeii, your friend Ninnius came to tell me that
the centurions of three cohorts who were there, asked to see
me the next day, as they wished to deliver up the place to
me. Do you know what I did? I went away before daylight
in order not to see them. What are, in fact, three
cohorts? And if there had been more, what should I have
done with them?”<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c013'><sup>[173]</sup></a> This was speaking like a prudent
man and one who knows himself well. As for Atticus we
ask whether he were really sincere in the ardour that he
showed for his cause when we see him obstinately refuse to
serve it. Those grand passions that confine themselves
so prudently in the breast, and never show themselves outwardly,
are with good reason suspected. Perhaps he only
wished to enliven a little that part of spectator that he
had reserved for himself by taking part, up to a certain
point, in the excitement of the struggle. The wise man of
Epicurus always remains on the serene heights whence he
tranquilly enjoys the view of shipwrecks and the spectacle
of human conflicts; but he enjoys them from too far off,
and the pleasure that he feels is diminished by the distance.
Atticus is more skilful and understands his pleasure better;
he goes into the midst of the fight itself, he sees it close, and
takes part in it, while always sure that he will retire in time.</p>

<p class='c014'>The only difficulty he found was to make everybody
accept his neutrality. This difficulty was so much the
greater for him as his conduct especially offended those
whose esteem he was the most anxious to preserve. The
republican party, which he preferred, and in which he
reckoned most friends, was much less inclined to pardon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>him than that of Caesar. In antiquity itself, and still more
in our days, great praise has been bestowed on that saying
of Caesar at the beginning of the civil war: “He who is
not against me is for me,” and the contrary saying of
Pompey has been much blamed: “He who is not for me
is against me.” However, looking at things fairly, this
praise and this blame appear equally unreasonable. Each
of the two rivals, when he expressed himself thus, speaks in
character, and their words were suggested by their position.
Caesar, however we may judge him, came to overturn the
established order, and he naturally was grateful to those
who gave him a free hand. What more could he reasonably
ask of them? In reality, those who did not hinder him
served him. But lawful order, established order, considers
it has the right to call upon every one to defend it, and to
regard as enemies all who do not respond to its appeal, for
it is a generally recognized principle that he who does not
bring help to the law when openly attacked before him,
makes himself the accomplice of those who violate it. It
was, then, natural that Caesar, on arriving at Rome, should
welcome Atticus and those who had not gone to Pharsalia,
as it was also that those in Pompey’s camp should be
very much irritated against them. Atticus was not much
moved by this anger: he let them talk, those thoughtless
and fiery young men who could not console themselves for
having left Rome, and who threatened to avenge themselves
on those who had remained. What did these menaces
matter to him? He was sure that he had preserved the
esteem of the two most important and most respected men
of the party, and he could oppose their testimony to all the
indignation of the rest. Cicero and Brutus, notwithstanding
the strength of their convictions, never blamed him for his
conduct, and they appear to have approved of his not
taking part in public affairs. “I know the honourable and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>noble character of your sentiments, said Cicero to him
one day when Atticus thought it necessary to defend himself;
there is only one difference between us, and that is, that
we have arranged our lives differently. I know not what
ambition made me desire public office, while motives in
no way blameworthy have made you seek an honourable
leisure!”<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c013'><sup>[174]</sup></a> Again, Brutus wrote to him towards the end of
his life: “I am far from blaming you, Atticus; your age, your
character, your family, everything makes you love repose.”<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c013'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>This good-will on the part of Brutus and Cicero is so
much the more surprising, as they knew very well the
mischief such an example might do to the cause that they
defended. The republic did not perish by the audacity of
its enemies alone, but also by the apathy of its partisans.
The sad spectacle it offered for fifty years, the public sale of
dignities, the scandalous violence that took place on the
Forum every time a new law was discussed, the battles that
at each new election stained the Campus Martius with
blood, those armies of gladiators needed for self-defence, all
those shameful disorders, all those base intrigues in which
the last strength of Rome was used up, had completely discouraged
honest men. They held aloof from public life;
they had no more relish for power since they were forced
to dispute it with men ready for every violence. It required
Cato’s courage to return to the Forum after having been
received with showers of stones, and having come out with
torn robe and bleeding head. Thus, the more the audacious
attempted, the more the timid let them alone, and from the
time of the first triumvirate and the consulship of Bibulus,
it was evident that the apathy of honest men would deliver
the republic over to the ambitious nobles who desired to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>dominate it. Cicero saw this clearly, and in his letters
never ceases his bitter railleries against those indolent rich
men, doting on their fish-ponds, who consoled themselves
for the ruin that they foresaw by thinking that they
would save at least their lampreys. In the introduction to
the <cite>De Republica</cite> he attacks with admirable energy those
who, being discouraged themselves, try to discourage others,
who maintain that a man has the right to withhold his services
from his country, and to consult his own welfare while
neglecting that of his country. “Let us not listen,” says he
in finishing, “to that signal for retreat that sounds in our
ears, and would recall those who have already gone to the
front.”<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c013'><sup>[176]</sup></a> Brutus also knew the evil of which the republic
was dying, and complained more than once of the weakness
and discouragement of the Romans. “Believe me,” he
wrote, “we are too much afraid of exile, death, and
poverty.”<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c013'><sup>[177]</sup></a> It was Atticus to whom he wrote these noble
words, and yet he does not dream of applying them to
him! What strange charm then did this man possess, what
influence did his friendship exercise, that these two great
patriots have thus belied themselves in his favour, and have
so freely pardoned in him what they condemned in others?</p>

<p class='c014'>The more we think of it, the less can we imagine the
reasons he could give them to justify his conduct. If he
had been one of those scholars who, wedded to their researches
in history or philosophy, only dwell in the past
or the future, and are not really the contemporaries of the
people with whom they live, we might have understood his
not taking part in their struggles since he held himself aloof
from their passions; but we know that, on the contrary, he
had the most lively relish for all the small agitations and
obscure intrigues of the politics of his time. He was anxious
to know them, he excelled in unravelling them, this was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>regular food of his inquisitive mind, and Cicero applied to
him by choice when he wished to know about such matters.
He was not one of those gentle and timid souls, made for
reflection and solitude, who have not the energy necessary
for active life. This man of business, of clear and decided
judgment, would, on the contrary, have made an excellent
statesman. To be useful to his country he would only have
needed to employ in its service a little of that activity and
intelligence he had used to enrich himself, and Cicero was
right in thinking that he had the political temperament.
And, finally, he had not even left himself the poor resource
of pretending that he sided with no party because all
parties were indifferent to him, and that, having no settled
opinions, he did not know which side to take. He had
said the contrary a hundred times in his letters to Cicero and
Brutus; he had charmed them a hundred times by the
ardour of his republican zeal, and yet he remained quiet
when the opportunity came of serving this government to
which he said he was so much attached. Instead of making
a single effort to retard its fall, he was only careful not to be
crushed under its ruins. But if he did not try to defend
it, did he, at least, pay it that last respect of appearing to
regret it? Did he show in any way that, although he had
not appeared in the combat, he felt that he shared in the
defeat? Did he know, while he grew old under a power to
which he was forced to submit, how to retire in a dignified
sadness which forces respect even from a conqueror? No,
and it is assuredly this that is most repugnant to us in his
life; he showed an unpleasant eagerness to accommodate
himself to the new order of things. The day after he had
himself been proscribed, we see him become the friend of
the proscribers. He lavishes all the charms of his mind on
them, assiduously frequents their houses, attends all their
<i><span lang="fr">fêtes</span></i>. However habituated we may be to see him welcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>all triumphant governments, we cannot get used to the
notion that the friend of Brutus and the confidant of Cicero
should become so quickly the familiar of Antony and
Octavius. Those most disposed to indulgence will certainly
think that those illustrious friendships created duties which
he did not fulfil, and that it was a treason to the memory
of these men who had honoured him with their friendship,
to choose just their executioners as their successors.</p>

<p class='c014'>If we are not disposed to show ourselves as indulgent
towards him as Cicero and Brutus, with still more reason
shall we not partake in the naïve enthusiasm that he inspires
in Cornelius Nepos. This indulgent biographer is only
struck, in the whole life of his hero, with the happy chance
by which he escaped such great dangers. He cannot get
over his surprise when he sees him, from the time of Sulla
to that of Augustus, withdraw himself from so many civil wars,
survive so many proscriptions, and preserve himself so skilfully
where so many others perished. “If we overwhelm
with praises,” says he, “the pilot who saves his vessel from the
rocks and tempests, ought we not to consider admirable the
prudence of a man who in the midst of those violent political
storms succeeded in saving himself?”<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c013'><sup>[178]</sup></a> Admiration is here
too strong a word. We keep that for those courageous men
who made their actions agree with their principles, and who
knew how to die to defend their opinions. Their ill success
does not injure them in our esteem, and, whatever the
friend of Atticus may say, there are fortunate voyages from
which less honour is drawn than from some shipwrecks.
The sole praise that he thoroughly deserves is that which
his biographer gives him with so much complacency, namely,
that he was the most adroit man of that time; but we
know that there are other forms of praise which are of more
value than this.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CAELIUS</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>THE ROMAN YOUTH IN THE TIME OF CAESAR</h3>

<p class='c015'>There is perhaps no more curious figure than that of
Caelius in the history we are studying. His life has a
special interest for us. He was not, like Brutus, a brilliant
exception among his contemporaries; on the contrary, he
quite belongs to his time; he lived as others lived around
him. All the young men of that time, the Curios, the Dolabellas,
resemble him. They are all, like him, corrupted
early, little concerned about their dignity, prodigal of their
wealth, friends of facile pleasures; they all throw themselves
into public life as soon as they can, with a restless ambition
and great needs to satisfy, and with few scruples and no
beliefs. His history, then, is that of all the rest, and the
advantage we find in studying it is that we know at once
the whole generation of which he formed part. Now, thanks
to Cicero, this study is easy for us. Notwithstanding so
many differences in conduct and principles, Cicero always
felt a singular inclination for Caelius; he liked the conversation
of this clever man who laughed at everything, and
was more at ease with him than with people like Cato or
Brutus, whose severity somewhat alarmed him. He defended
him in the law courts when a woman whom he had loved
tried to ruin him, and this speech of his is certainly one of
the most interesting that remain to us. Later, when he
was obliged to go to Cilicia, he chose him for his political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>correspondent. By a happy chance Caelius’ letters have
come down to us with those of Cicero, and there are none
in all this collection that are more witty and more racy.
Let us collect all the details scattered through them; let us
try, in collecting them, to reproduce an account of Caelius,
and by it to gain an idea of what the Roman youth of that
time was. It is not without interest to know them, for they
played an important part, and Caesar made use of them
more especially for the revolution that he wished to
accomplish.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>I.</h4>

<p class='c015'>Caelius did not come of an illustrious family. He was
the son of a Roman knight of Puteoli, who had been in
trade and acquired great wealth in Africa. His father, who
had all his life no other concern than that of enriching himself,
showed, as often happens, more ambition for his son
than for himself: he wished him to become a politician, and
as he saw that dignities were reached only through eloquence,
he took him betimes to Cicero, that he might make him a
great orator, if it were possible.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was not yet the custom to confine young men to the
schools of the rhetoricians, and to be contented with exercising
them in imaginary cases. As soon as they had assumed
the <i><span lang="la">toga virilis</span></i>, that is, when they were about sixteen years
old, no time was lost in taking them to some statesman of
reputation, whom they did not leave. Admitted to his most
intimate society, they listened to his conversations with his
friends, his disputations with his adversaries; they saw him
prepare himself in silence for the great battles of eloquence,
they followed him into the basilicas and the Forum, they
heard him pleading causes or speaking to the assembled
people, and when they had become capable of speaking
themselves, they made their first appearance at his side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and under his patronage. Tacitus much regrets this manly
education, which, placing a young man under the conditions
of reality instead of retaining him among the fictions of
rhetoric, gave him a taste for real and natural eloquence
which strengthened him, by throwing him from the first into
the midst of real contests, and, according to his expression,
taught him war on the field of battle, <i><span lang="la">pugnare in praelio
discebant</span></i>.<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c013'><sup>[179]</sup></a> This education, however, had its dangers. It
taught him things that it is better to be ignorant of for a
long time, it familiarized him with the scandalous and
corrupt sights that public life usually offers, it gave him
a too rapid maturity and inflamed him with precocious ambition.
Must not a young man of sixteen, who thus lived
in intimacy with old and unscrupulous statesmen, and to
whom were laid bare without precaution the basest manœuvres
of parties, must he not have lost something of the
generosity and sensitiveness of his age? Was it not to be
feared that this corrupting intercourse might end by giving
him a taste for intrigue, for the worship of success, an unbridled
love of power, the desire to attain a high position
quickly and by any means, and as, generally, the worst means
are also the quickest, the temptation to employ them by
preference? This is what happened to Caelius. For three
entire years, three honest and laborious years, he did not
leave Cicero; but he perceived at length, that a young man
like himself, who had his political fortune to make, would
gain more with those who wished to destroy the government
than with him who wished to preserve it, and he abandoned
Cicero to attach himself to Catiline. The change was
sudden, but Caelius never took the trouble to delay about
these transitions. Henceforth, we can easily understand, his
life took another turn; he became a seditious and turbulent
man, whose biting speech in the Forum and violence in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Campus Martius were dreaded. At the election of a pontif
he struck a senator. When he was appointed quaestor,
every one accused him of having bought his votes. Not
content with disturbing the comitia at Rome, we see him
stirring up a popular tumult at Naples, we do not know
why. At the same time, he did not neglect his pleasures.
The debaucheries of those noisy young men of whom he
was one, continually disturbed the public peace. It is said
that the streets of Rome were unsafe when they returned at
night from their suppers, and that, after the manner of those
giddy fellows that Plautus and Terence depict, they molested
honest women whom they met on their road. All these
follies did not go on without great expense, and the father
of Caelius, although he was rich, was not of a temper to be
always paying. No doubt at this time the honest merchant
of Puteoli must have regretted his ambition for his son, and
thought it cost him dear to have wished to make him a
politician. Caelius, on his side, was not of a temper to put
up with reprimands easily; he left the paternal house, and,
under pretext of being nearer the Forum and business, rented
a lodging on the Palatine, in the house of the famous tribune
Appius Clodius, for ten thousand sesterces (£80). This
was an important event in his life, for it was there that he
became acquainted with Clodia.</p>

<p class='c014'>If we relied on the evidence of Cicero we should have
a very bad opinion of Clodia; but Cicero is a too partial
witness to be altogether just, and the furious hatred he
bore the brother renders him very much suspected when
he speaks of the sister. Moreover, he partly contradicts
himself when he tells us she had kept up relations with very
honourable people, which would be very surprising if it were
true that she had committed all the crimes that he lays to
her charge. It is very difficult to believe that persons of
consideration in the republic, and persons who were careful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of their reputation, would have continued to see her if they
had thought that she had poisoned her husband, and was
the mistress of her brothers. Cicero, however, did not
invent this; it was public rumour that he complacently
repeated. Many people in Rome believed it, Clodia’s
enemies liked to repeat it, and mischievous verses were
made about it which were written upon every wall. Clodia’s
reputation was, then, very bad, and it must be admitted
that, notwithstanding some exaggerations, she partly deserved
it. There is nothing to show that she killed her husband,
as she was accused of doing; these accusations of poisoning
were then widespread, and were accepted with incredible
levity, but she had made him very unhappy during his life,
and did not appear very much grieved at his death. It is
doubtful, also, whatever Cicero may assert, that her brothers
were her lovers, but it is unfortunately too certain that she
had a good many others. The sole excuse that can be
pleaded for her is that this way of living was then very
general. Scandals of this kind had never been more
common among the great ladies of Rome. Roman society
was passing through a crisis whose causes, which go back
a long way, deserve to be considered. We must say a few
words about them, in order to account for the grave injury
that public morals had received.</p>

<p class='c014'>In a country where the family was respected as it was at
Rome, women could not fail to have much importance. It
was impossible that their influence, which was already so
great within the house, should not attempt to show itself
outside, and the honourable place they held in private life
must one day tempt them to invade public life also. The
ancient Romans, so jealous of their authority, had the consciousness
of this danger, and neglected nothing in order to
defend themselves against it. We know how they affected to
treat women; there was no sort of unkind remarks they did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>not make about them; they got them attacked on the stage
and mocked them even in their political speeches:<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c013'><sup>[180]</sup></a> but we
must not mistake the sense of these railleries and pity the
objects of them too much. They are only attacked thus
because they are feared, and all these pleasantries are not so
much insults as precautions. These rough soldiers, these
rude peasants, have learnt, in living with them, how subtle
and enterprising their minds are, and in how many ways they
are more capable than themselves; consequently they take
a good deal of trouble to confine them to their households,
and even that does not suffice to reassure them; in the
household itself they must be subjugated and bridled. They
affect to think and to say that they are weak and untamed
beings (<i><span lang="la">indomita animalia</span></i>), incapable of governing themselves
alone, and they hasten to provide for their management.
They are kept, under this pretext, in a continual
state of tutelage; they are always “under the hand” of their
father, brother, or husband; they cannot sell, buy, trade, or
do anything without a council to assist them: in acting thus
the men pretend they are protecting them, in reality it is
themselves they are protecting against them. Cato, their
great enemy, ingenuously admits it in a moment of frankness.
“Remember,” Livy makes him say <i><span lang="fr">à propos</span></i> of the
<i><span lang="la">lex Oppia</span></i>, “all those regulations our ancestors made to
subject wives to their husbands. Shackled as they are, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>have trouble to manage them. What will happen if you
give them their liberty, if you allow them to enjoy the same
rights as yourselves? Do you think you will then be their
masters? The day they become your equals they will be
your superiors.”<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c013'><sup>[181]</sup></a> This day arrived just about the time of
which we are treating. In the midst of the weakening of
ancient usages, the laws against women were not more
respected than others. Cicero says that the gallant lawyers
furnished them with ingenious means to free themselves
from these laws without appearing to violate them.<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c013'><sup>[182]</sup></a> At
the same time, men were accustomed to see them take a
more important place in society, and to recognize their influence
in the government of the republic. Almost all the
politicians of that time are governed by their wives or by
their mistresses, thus the innumerable gallantries of Caesar
must have passed in the eyes of many people, as later those
of Augustus did, for profound policy, as it might be supposed
that he only sought to please the women in order to lead
their husbands.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus, by the abolition of the old laws, and by the
alteration of ancient maxims, women had become free.
Now, it is to be remarked that, in general, the first use
made of regained liberty is to abuse it. We cannot enjoy
quietly the rights of which we have been long deprived,
and the first moments of liberty bring a sort of intoxication
that it is difficult to check. This is what happened to the
Roman society of that time, and all these irregularities
that we notice in the conduct of women then are partly
explained by the allurements and intoxication of their new
liberty. Those who love money, like Terentia, Cicero’s
wife, hasten to take advantage of the right of disposing of
their fortune, that has been restored to them, they associate
themselves with freedmen and agents for doubtful gains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>rob their husbands without scruple, and throw themselves
into speculations and trade, to which they bring, together
with an almost incredible rapacity, that taste for small
savings and economies which is natural to them. Those
who prefer pleasure to wealth give themselves up to all
pleasures with a passionate eagerness. The less bold
take advantage of the facilities of divorce to pass from one
amour to another under cover of the law. Others do not
even take this trouble, and impudently flaunt their scandalous
behaviour.</p>

<p class='c014'>Clodia was one of the latter; but among all her vices,
which she took no care to hide, we are forced to recognize
in her some good qualities. She was not grasping; her
purse was open to her friends, and Caelius was not ashamed
to dip into it. She liked clever men, and attracted them
to her house. At one time she wished to persuade Cicero,
whose talents she much admired, to give up his foolish
Terentia for her and to marry her; but Terentia, who
suspected it, succeeded in mortally embroiling them. An
old scholiast says that she danced better than it was proper
for an honest woman to do.<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c013'><sup>[183]</sup></a> This was not the only art
for which she had a taste, and it has been thought possible
to infer from a passage of Cicero that she also wrote verses.<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c013'><sup>[184]</sup></a>
To cultivate letters, to seek out clever men, to like refined
and elegant pleasures, does not seem at first sight to be
blameworthy; on the contrary, these are among us the
qualities that a woman of society is obliged to possess or
to feign. They thought otherwise at Rome, and, as the
courtesans alone had then the privilege of following this
free and accomplished life, every woman who sought this
ran the risk of being confounded with them, and of being
treated with the same rigour by public opinion; but Clodia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>did not care for public opinion. She brought into her
private conduct, into her affections, the same passionateness
and the same ardour that her brother did into public life.
Ready for all excesses, and not blushing to avow them,
loving and hating furiously, incapable of self-control, and
hating all restraint, she did not belie that great and haughty
family from which she was descended, and even in her vices
her blood was recognized. In a country where so much
respect was shown for ancient customs, in that classic land
of <i><span lang="la">decorum</span></i> (the thing and the word are Roman), Clodia
took pleasure in shocking the established customs; she
went out publicly with her male friends; she was accompanied
by them in the public gardens or on the Appian road,
constructed by her great ancestor. She boldly accosted
people whom she knew; instead of timidly lowering her
eyes as a well-brought-up matron should have done, she
dared to speak to them (Cicero says that she even kissed
them sometimes), and invited them to her repasts. Grave,
staid, and rigid people were indignant; but the young,
whom this freedom did not displease, were charmed, and
went to dine with Clodia.<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c013'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Caelius was at that time one of the fashionable young
men of Rome. Already he had a great reputation as an
orator. He was dreaded for the satirical sharpness of his
speech. He was bold to temerity, always ready to throw
himself into the most perilous enterprises. He spent his
money freely, and drew after him a train of friends and
clients. Few men danced as well as he,<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c013'><sup>[186]</sup></a> no one surpassed
him in the art of dressing with taste, and the beauty and
breadth of the purple band that bordered his toga were
spoken of on all hands in Rome. All these qualities, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>serious as well as the trivial, were of a nature to attract
Clodia. Neighbourhood made their acquaintance more
easy, and she soon became the mistress of Caelius.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero, notwithstanding his reserve, permits us to guess
the life they then led. He speaks in hints of those
brilliant <i><span lang="fr">fêtes</span></i> that Clodia gave to her lover and to the
youth of Rome in her gardens on the banks of the Tiber;
but it seems that Baiae was the chief theatre of these
amours. Baiae had been for some time already the
regular rendezvous of the fashionable people of Rome
and Italy. The hot-springs that are found there in abundance
served as the occasion or pretext for these gatherings.
Some invalids went there for their health, and their presence
provided an excuse for a crowd of healthy people who
went there to amuse themselves. People flocked there
from the month of April, and during the fine season a
thousand light intrigues were carried on, the report of
which reached Rome. Grave folks took great care not to
be seen in this whirl of pleasure, and later Clodius accused
Cicero, as if it were a crime, simply of having passed through
it; but Caelius and Clodia were not anxious to hide themselves;
consequently they gave themselves up without
restraint to all the pleasures that were to be found in that
country that Horace calls the most beautiful in the world.
All Rome talked of their races on the shore, the brilliancy
of their feasts and water-parties in boats carrying singers
and musicians. This is all that Cicero tells us, or rather
only gives us a glimpse of, for, contrary to his habit, and to
our great loss, he has for once in a way been discreet, in
order not to compromise his friend Caelius. Fortunately
we can learn more about this society and satisfy our
curiosity; to do so we have only to turn ourselves to
him who was, with Lucretius, the greatest poet of that time,
Catullus. Catullus lived among these persons who were so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>well worthy of study, and had relations with them which
permitted him to depict them well. Everybody knows that
Lesbia whom his verses have immortalized; but it is not
so well known that Lesbia was not one of those fictitious
persons that the elegiac poets often create. Ovid tells us that
this name covered that of a Roman lady, probably a great
lady, since he will not name her, and by his way of speaking
we see clearly that everybody then knew her.<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c013'><sup>[187]</sup></a> Apuleius,
who lived much later, is less reticent, and he tells us that
Lesbia was Clodia.<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c013'><sup>[188]</sup></a> Catullus, then, was the lover of Clodia,
and the rival of Caelius: he also frequented that house on
the Palatine, and those fine gardens on the Tiber, and his
verses complete our knowledge of that society of which he
was one of the heroes.</p>

<p class='c014'>I said just now that Clodia did not love money with the
avidity of the women of gallantry of that time and of all
times. The history of Catullus proves this well. This
young provincial of Verona, although he belonged to an
honourable family, was not very rich, and after he had
lived a life of dissipation and pleasure for some time at
Rome, he had nothing left. His poor little estate was soon
deeply mortgaged. “It is not exposed, he says gaily,
either to the impetuous north wind, or to the fury of the
<i><span lang="la">auster</span></i>: it is a hurricane of debts that blows on it from all
sides. Oh! the horrible and pestilent wind!”<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c013'><sup>[189]</sup></a> By the
picture that he draws of some of his friends, still poorer and
more indebted than himself, we see clearly that he could not
reckon upon them, and that his purse which was “full of
spiders” had no great help to expect from them. It was not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>then, fortune or birth that Clodia loved in Catullus, but wit
and talent. What attracted him in her, what he so passionately
loved, was distinction and grace. These are not usually
the qualities of women who live like Clodia; but, however
low she might have descended, she was still a great lady.
Catullus says so in an epigram in which he compares
Lesbia to a celebrated beauty of that time—“Quintia is
considered beautiful by many men. I think her tall, fair,
erect: these are her attractions; I recognize them all.
But that their union forms beauty, that I deny. There is
nothing graceful in her, and in all that vast body there is
not a spark of wit or charm. It is Lesbia who is beautiful,
more beautiful than all, and she has so much grace that
there is none left for the rest.”<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c013'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>A woman like Clodia, who had such a decided taste for
clever people, must have been pleased to frequent the
society in which Catullus lived. We see plainly, by what
he relates to us of it, that there was none more witty and
agreeable in Rome. It united writers and politicians, poets
and noblemen, differing in position and fortune, but all
friends of letters and pleasure. There were Cornificius,
Quintilius Varus, Helvius Cinna, whose verses had then
much reputation, Asinius Pollio, who was as yet only a
youth of great promise; there was above all Licinius Calvus,
at once statesman and poet, one of the most striking
figures of that time, who, at twenty-one, had attacked
Vatinius with so much vigour, that Vatinius, terrified, had
turned towards his judges, saying: “If my opponent is a
great orator, it does not follow that I am guilty!” In the
same group we must place Caelius, who, by his wit and
tastes, was worthy to belong to it, and over it Cicero the
protector of all this brilliant youth, which was proud of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>genius and renown, and which saluted in him, according to
the expression of Catullus, the most eloquent of the sons
of Romulus.</p>

<p class='c014'>In these assemblies of clever men, of whom many were
political personages, politics were not excluded; they were
very republican, and from them issued the most violent
epigrams against Caesar. We know the tone in which those
of Catullus are written; Calvus had composed others which
are lost, and which were, it is said, still more cutting.
Literature, however, we can well understand, held in them
at least as high a place as politics. They did not fail to
laugh at bad writers from time to time, and in order to
make an example, ceremoniously burnt the poems of
Volusius. Sometimes, at the end of the repast, when wine
and laughter had heated their brains, they sent each other
poetic challenges; the tablets passed from hand to hand,
and each wrote the most incisive verses he could make.
But it was pleasure more than anything else that occupied
them. All these poets and politicians were young and
amorous, and whatever pleasure they may have found in
rallying Volusius, or tearing Caesar to pieces, they preferred
to sing their loves. It is this which has made them famous.
The lyrical poetry of the Latins has nothing to compare
with those short and charming pieces that Catullus wrote
for Lesbia. Propertius mingles too much mythology with
his sighs; Ovid is only an inspired debauchee, Catullus
alone has tones that touch the heart, because he alone was
mastered by a deep and sincere love. Till then he had
led a gay and dissipated life, and his heart was wearied
with passing connections; but the day that he met Lesbia
he learnt the meaning of passion. Whatever we may think
of Clodia, the love of Catullus elevates her, and we never
see her in a more favourable light than in this exquisite
poetry. The verses of Catullus seem to make real and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>living those <i><span lang="fr">fêtes</span></i> that she gave to the youth of Rome, and
of which we regretted just now the absence of sufficient
details; for was it not for these charming parties, for these
free and sumptuous repasts, that he composed his finest
works? It was there, no doubt, under the groves on the
banks of the Tiber, that he sang that fine imitation of
Sappho’s most fervid ode that he made for Lesbia. It was,
perhaps, on the shore of Baiae, fronting Naples and Capreae,
under that voluptuous sky, in the midst of the attractions
of that enchanted land, that for the first time were read
those verses in which so much grace is mingled with so
much passion, and which are so worthy of the exquisite landscape
in the midst of which I take pleasure in placing them:</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let us live, let us love, my Lesbia, and laugh together
at all the reproaches of stern old age. The sun dies to be
born again; but we, when our short-lived light is once
extinguished, must sleep an eternal night without awakening.
Give me a thousand kisses, a hundred, a thousand, a
hundred once more, then a thousand and a hundred
again. Afterwards, when we have embraced thousands of
times, we will confuse the reckoning to know it no longer,
and leave the jealous no pretext to envy us by letting them
know how many kisses we have given each other.”<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c013'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>That is a remarkable moment in Roman society, when
we meet with these polished assemblies, in which everything
is talked of and all ranks are mingled, where the writers
have their place beside the politicians, where they dare
openly express their love for the arts and treat imagination
as a power. We may say, to use a quite modern expression,
that it is here that the life of society begins.
There was nothing like it among the old Romans. They lived
on the Forum or in their houses. Between the multitude
and the family they knew little of that middle point that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>we call society, that is to say, those elegant and select
assemblies, numerous without confusion, where we are at
once more at liberty than among unknown persons in public
places, and yet less at home than in the family circle.
Before reaching this point it was necessary to wait until
Rome was civilized and literature had won her place, which
scarcely happened until the last age of the republic. And
yet we must not exaggerate. That <em>society</em> which then had
its beginning, seems to us at times very coarse. Catullus
tells us that at those luxurious entertainments where such
fine poems were read, there were guests who would even
steal the napkins.<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c013'><sup>[192]</sup></a> The conversations they held were often
risky, to judge by certain epigrams of the great poet.
Clodia who assembled at her house these clever men, had
singular eccentricities of conduct. The elegant pleasures
sought by a woman of society were far from satisfying her,
and she fell at last into excesses that made her former
friends blush. They themselves, those heroes of fashion,
whose good taste was vaunted on all sides, who talked with
so much charm and made such tender verses, did not
behave much better than she, and were not much more
delicate. They had much to reproach themselves with
while their connection with Clodia lasted; when it ended,
they committed the unpardonable fault of not respecting
the past, and of failing in that consideration that is always
due to a woman whom one has once loved. Catullus stung
with coarse epigrams her who had inspired his finest verses.
Caelius, alluding to the price paid to the vilest courtesans,
called her, in open court, the quarter of an as (<i><span lang="la">quadrantaria</span></i>)
woman, and this cruel epithet stuck to her. We see that
this society had still much progress to make; but it will do
it quickly, thanks to the monarchy which was about to
commence. Everything changed with Augustus. Under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the new government, these remains of coarseness which
savoured of the old republic, disappeared; men made such
progress, and became so fastidious, that the refined were
not slow in laughing at Calvus and Catullus, and that
Plautus passed for a barbarian. They polish and refine
themselves, and at the same time become insipid. A
courtly tone is spread over gallant literature, and the change
is so sudden, that little more than a quarter of a century
was needed for the descent from Catullus to Ovid. The
amours of Clodia and Catullus ended very sadly. Clodia
did not pride herself on being faithful, and justified her lover
only too well when he wrote to her: “A woman’s promises
must be confided to the wind, or written on running
water.”<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c013'><sup>[193]</sup></a> Catullus, who knew he was deceived, was angry
with himself for submitting to it. He reasoned with himself,
he chid himself, but he did not cure himself. Notwithstanding
all the trouble he took to gain courage, love was
the stronger. After painful struggles which rent his heart,
he returned sad and submissive to the feet of her whom he
could not help despising, and whom he yet continued to
love. “I love and I hate, said he; you ask me how that
can be, I cannot tell; but I feel that it is so, and my soul is
in tortures.”<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c013'><sup>[194]</sup></a> So much suffering and resignation touched
Clodia very slightly. She plunged deeper and deeper in
obscure amours, and the poor poet, who had no more
hope, was compelled to separate from her for ever. The
rupture between Clodia and Caelius was much more tragic.
It was by a criminal trial that their amour was ended.
This time Caelius wearied first. Clodia, who, as we have
seen, usually took the first step, was not used to such an end
to her amours. Enraged at being abandoned, she concerted
with the enemies of Caelius, who were not few, and had him
accused of several crimes, and particularly of having tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>to poison her. This, it must be admitted, was a very
sad morrow to the charming <i><span lang="fr">fêtes</span></i> of Baiae! The trial
must have been very amusing, and we may believe that
the Forum that day did not lack curious hearers. Caelius
appeared accompanied by those who had been his protectors,
his friends, and his teachers, the wealthy Crassus
and Cicero. They had divided his defence between them,
and Cicero specially undertook the part regarding Clodia.
Although he declared, in the opening of his speech, “that
he was not the enemy of women, and still less of a woman
who was the friend of all men,” we may well believe that
he did not miss such a good opportunity of avenging himself
for all the ill this family had done him. That day
Clodia suffered for her whole family. Never had Cicero
been so sharp and stinging; the judges must have laughed
much, and Caelius was acquitted.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero had solemnly promised in his speech that his
client would alter his conduct. In fact, it was quite time
for him to reform, his youth had lasted only too long. He
was then twenty-eight, and it was really time for him to
think of becoming aedile or tribune, if he wished to play
that political part that had been his father’s ambition for
him. We do not know whether, in the sequel, he rigorously
carried out all the undertakings Cicero had made in his
name; perhaps he avoided henceforth compromising himself
by too open scandals, and perhaps the ill success of his
amours with Clodia had cured him of these noisy adventures;
but it is very difficult to suppose that he became
austere and lived after the manner of the old Romans.
We see that, several years later when he was aedile and
taking part in the most serious business, he found time to
learn and repeat all the scandalous tales of Rome. This is
what he wrote to Cicero, then proconsul of Cilicia:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing new has happened except a few little adventures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>that, I am sure, you will be glad to hear about. Paula
Valeria, the sister of Triarius, has divorced herself, without
any reason, from her husband, the very day he was to arrive
from his province; she is going to marry Decimus Brutus.
Have you never suspected it? Since your absence incredible
things of this kind have happened. No one would
have believed that Servius Ocella was a man of intrigue, if
he had not been caught in the act twice in the space of
three days. You will ask me where? In truth it was
where I should not wish it to be,<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c013'><sup>[195]</sup></a> but I leave you something
to learn from others. I should be glad to think that a
victorious proconsul will go and ask everybody with what
woman a man has been caught.”<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c013'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Evidently he who wrote this entertaining letter was never
so thoroughly converted as Cicero made believe, and it
seems to me that we still find the harebrained young fellow
who made so much racket in the streets of Rome, and the
lover of Clodia, in the man of wit who recounts so pleasantly
these trifling intrigues. We may affirm, then, without
temerity that, although from this moment his private life is
unknown to us, he never entirely renounced the dissipations
of his youth, and that, magistrate and politician as he was,
he continued to the end to mix pleasure with business.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>II.</h4>

<p class='c015'>But Caelius was not only a hero of amorous adventures,
and did not content himself with the empty honour of
giving the tone for elegance of manners to the youth of
Rome. He had more solid qualities. Thanks to Cicero’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>lessons he speedily became a great orator. A short time
after he had escaped from this honourable tutelage, he
made a brilliant commencement in a case in which he was
opposed to Cicero himself, and this time the disciple beat
the master. Since this success his reputation had continued
to increase. There were orators in the Forum that men of
taste admired more, and whose gifts they considered more
perfect; there were none more dreaded than he, such was
the violence of his attack and the bitterness of his raillery.
He excelled in seizing the ridiculous side of his opponents,
and in making, in a very few words, those ironical and
cutting observations on them which are never forgotten.
Quintilian quotes one as a model of its kind, which well
exemplifies the talent of this terrible wit. He is speaking,
in this passage, of that Antony who had been the colleague
of Cicero in his consulship, and who, in spite of all the
eulogies that the Orations against Catiline lavish on him,
was but an inferior intriguer and a coarse debauchee. After
having, according to custom, pillaged Macedonia, which he
governed, he had attacked some neighbouring tribes in
order to obtain a pretext for a triumph. He counted upon
an easy victory, but as he was more taken up with his
pleasures than with the war, he was ignominiously beaten.
Caelius, who attacked him on his return, described, or
rather imagined, in his speech, one of those orgies during
which the general, while dead drunk, allowed himself to
be surprised by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Women, his ordinary officers, fill the banqueting-hall,
stretched on all the couches, or lying about on the ground.
When they learn that the enemy is come, half-dead with
fright, they try to awaken Antony; they shout his name,
they raise him up by the neck. Some whisper soft words
in his ear, others treat him more roughly and even strike
him; but he, who recognizes their voices and touch,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>stretches out his arms by habit, seizes and wishes to
embrace the first he meets with. He can neither sleep, so
much they shout to awaken him, nor wake, so drunk is he.
At last, powerless to shake off this drowsiness, he is carried
off in the arms of his centurions and his mistresses.”<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c013'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>When a man possesses such a biting and incisive talent
it is natural for him to have an aggressive temper; nothing
therefore suited Caelius better than personal struggles. He
liked and sought disputation because he was sure to succeed
in it, and because he could make use of those violent modes
of attack that could not be resisted. He wished to be contradicted,
for contradiction excited him and gave him
energy. Seneca relates that one day one of the clients of
Caelius, a man of pacific temper, and who, no doubt, had
suffered from his rudeness, confined himself during a meal
to agreeing with him. Caelius at last grew enraged because
the man gave him no opportunity for getting angry, and
exclaimed: “Do contradict me that there may be two of
us.”<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c013'><sup>[198]</sup></a> The talents of Caelius, such as I have just depicted
them, marvellously suited the time in which he lived. This
thoroughly explains the reputation that he enjoyed, and the
important position he took among his contemporaries.
This fiery debater, this pitiless wit, this vehement accuser
would not have been altogether in his place in quiet times;
but in the midst of a revolution he became a valuable
auxiliary whom all parties contended for. Caelius was
moreover a statesman as well as an orator, and it is for this
that Cicero most frequently praises him. “I know no one,
he told him, who is a better politician than you.”<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c013'><sup>[199]</sup></a> He
knew men thoroughly, he had a clear insight into situations;
he decided quickly, a quality that Cicero much appreciated
in others, for it was just that which he most lacked, and
when once he had decided, he set to work with a vigour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and force that gained him the sympathies of the multitude.
At a time when power belonged to those who were
bold enough to seize it, the audacity of Caelius seemed to
promise him a brilliant political future.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nevertheless, he had also great defects, which sometimes
arose from his very good qualities. He knew men well, a
great advantage no doubt, but in studying them it was
their bad side that struck him most. By dint of trying
them in every way, his startling penetration succeeded in
laying bare some weakness. He did not reserve his severity
for his adversaries only; his best friends did not escape his
clear-sighted analysis. We see in his private correspondence
that he knew all their defects, and did not stand on
ceremony in speaking of them. Dolabella, his companion
in pleasure, is a poor babbler, “incapable of keeping a
secret, even though his imprudence should ruin him.”<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c013'><sup>[200]</sup></a>
Curio, his usual associate in political intrigues, “is only an
unstable busybody, changing with every breath of wind,
who can do nothing sensible,”<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c013'><sup>[201]</sup></a> nevertheless, at the time
when he is treating them thus, Curio and Dolabella had
sufficient influence over him to draw him into Caesar’s
party. As to Caesar himself, he speaks no better of him,
although he is preparing to embrace his cause. This son of
Venus, as he calls him, appears to him “but an egotist who
scoffs at the interests of the republic and only cares for his
own,”<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c013'><sup>[202]</sup></a> and he has no scruple in confessing that in his
camp, where, nevertheless, he is going, there are only dishonourable
men, “all of whom have causes for apprehension
in the past and criminal hopes for the future.”<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c013'><sup>[203]</sup></a> With such
a disposition of mind, and so decided a leaning to judge
every one harshly, it was natural that Caelius should not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>trust any one entirely, and that no one dared to count upon
him with confidence. To serve a cause usefully you must
give yourself up to it completely; now, how can you do so if
you cannot shut your eyes a little and not see too clearly its
bad sides? Those cautious and clear-sighted persons, who
are entirely taken up with the fear of being dupes, and who
always see the faults of others so plainly, are never anything
but lukewarm friends and useless allies. While they inspire
no confidence in the party that they wish to serve, because
they always make reservations in serving it, they are not
sufficiently enthusiastic to form a party themselves, and
always fall short of that degree of passion that leads a man
to undertake great things. Therefore it happens that, as
they can neither be chiefs nor privates, and cannot attach
themselves to others or attach others to themselves, they
end by finding themselves alone.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us add that Caelius, who had no illusions about
persons, seemed also to have no preference for parties.
He never sought the reputation of being a man of principle,
nor to put order and consistency into his political life. In
that, as in his private affairs, he lived from hand to mouth.
The circumstances of the moment, interest, or friendship,
gave him an accidental conviction to which he did not
pretend to be long faithful. He went over from Cicero
to Catiline when Catiline seemed to him the stronger; he
returned to Cicero when Cicero was victorious. He was
the friend of Clodias as long as he remained Clodia’s lover;
he abandoned the brother at the same time that he left the
sister, and suddenly embraced Milo’s party. He passed
several times from the people to the senate, and from the
senate to the people without scruple or embarrassment.
At bottom, the cause that he served was of little consequence
to him, and he had not to make much effort to
disengage himself from it. At the time that he seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>to be taking the most trouble for it, he spoke of it in a
tone that left people to imagine it was quite foreign to
him. Even in the gravest affairs, and when it was a question
of the fate of the republic, he did not appear to
suppose that it had anything to do with him, and that he
was interested in its safety or ruin. “It is your business,
rich old men,”<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c013'><sup>[204]</sup></a> he said. But what did it matter to him?
As he is always ruined he never has anything to lose.
Therefore all forms of government are indifferent to him,
and curiosity alone makes him take an interest in these
struggles, in which, nevertheless, he plays such an active
part. If he plunges with so much ardour into the tumult
of public life, it is because events and men are seen closer,
and one can make piquant reflections on it, or find amusing
scenes in it. When he announces to Cicero, with remarkable
perspicacity, the approaching civil war and the misfortunes
that are coming, he adds: “If you were not
running some risk, I should say that fortune was preparing
a great and curious spectacle for you!”<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c013'><sup>[205]</sup></a> A cruel speech
that Caelius paid for dearly in the sequel, for one does not
play at these deadly games without peril, and often becomes
a victim while thinking to be only a spectator.</p>

<p class='c014'>When this war, which he thus announced to Cicero, was
on the point of breaking out, Caelius had just been
appointed aedile, and his great anxiety was to have some
Cilician panthers for the games that he wished to give to
the people. At this time, after having belonged more or
less to all parties, he made profession of defending the
cause of the senate, that is to say, that in speaking of the
senators, he said, “our friends,” and that he affected to
call them “good citizens”; which did not prevent him,
according to his custom, having his eyes open to the faults
that the “good citizens” might commit, and scoffing at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“friends” bitterly when the opportunity presented itself.
Cicero thought him cold and undecided; he would have
wished to see him pledge himself deeper. At the time of
his departure for Cilicia, he did not cease to extol the great
qualities of Pompey to him: “Believe me, he said, trust
yourself to this great man, he will gladly welcome you.”<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c013'><sup>[206]</sup></a>
But Caelius took good care not to do anything of the kind.
He knew Pompey, of whom he has drawn satirical portraits
on different occasions; he did not much admire him, and
did not like him at all. If he kept aloof from him at the
time of his greatest power, he certainly would not, we can
well understand, throw himself into his arms when this
power was threatened. In proportion as the crisis that he
had foreseen advanced, he took more care to hold himself
in reserve, and waited for the turn of events.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was, moreover, a time when the most honourable
hesitated. This irresolution, which does not seem to have
been very surprising then, has been much blamed in our
days. It is easy, however, to understand this. Questions
do not present themselves to the eyes of contemporaries
with the same clearness as to those of posterity. When
they are looked at from a distance, and with a mind free
from all prejudice; when, besides, the results and the causes
are taken in at the same time, and when we can judge the
causes by the results, nothing is easier than to come to a
decision; but it is not so when one lives in the midst of
the events, and too near them to take in the whole, when
one’s mind is influenced by previous ties or personal preferences,
and when the decision one is about to take may
endanger one’s safety and fortune. It is not possible, then,
to see things so clearly. The state of anarchy in which
the old parties of the Roman republic were added to the
confusion at that time. To speak the truth, there were no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>longer parties, but coalitions. For fifty years they had
struggled, not for questions of principle, but for personal
questions. Parties being no longer organized as formerly,
it followed that timid minds which have need to attach
themselves to ancient traditions to guide them, drifted
about, and often changed. These striking changes of
opinion in honourable and respected persons disturbed the
less settled minds, and rendered it difficult to make out the
right. Caesar, who knew of these vacillations, and hoped to
profit by them, did what he could to increase their causes.
At the very moment when he was preparing to destroy the
constitution of his country, he had the art to appear to
respect it more than anybody. An expert judge in these
matters, and one who knows the Roman laws thoroughly,
has declared, after mature examination, that the law was on
the side of Caesar, and that the grievances he complained
of were well founded.<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c013'><sup>[207]</sup></a> He took good care not to disclose
all his projects then, or to speak with so much freedom as
he did afterwards, when he was master. Sometimes he
presented himself as the successor of the Gracchi, and the
defender of popular rights; sometimes he affected to say,
in order to reassure everybody, that the republic was not
interested in the dispute, and reduced the quarrel to a
struggle for influence between two powerful competitors.
While he was gathering his legions in the cities of Upper
Italy, he only spoke of his desire to preserve the public
peace; in proportion as his enemies became more violent
he became more moderate, and he never proposed conditions
so acceptable as when he was sure that the senate
would not listen to them. On the other side, on the contrary,
in the camp where moderate and wise men ought to
be found, there was nothing but rashness and stupidity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Those who showed some repugnance to civil war were
treated as public enemies; they talked only of proscribing
and confiscating, and the example of Sulla was in every
one’s mouth. It happened then, by a strange contradiction,
that it was in the camp where profession was made of
defending liberty, that exceptional measures were most
persistently demanded; and while the man who expected
everything from the war, and whose army was ready, offered
peace, those who had not a soldier under arms were eager
to refuse it. Thus the two sides exchanged characters, and
each appeared to speak and act contrary to its interests, or
its principles. Is it surprising that in the midst of such
obscurity, and among so many reasons for hesitation,
honourable men like Sulpicius and Cicero, devoted to
their country, but fitter to serve it in quiet times than in
these violent crises, should not have decided at once?</p>

<p class='c014'>Caelius also hesitated; but not altogether for the same
reasons as Cicero and Sulpicius. While they anxiously
asked themselves where the right lay, Caelius only sought
where the superior force lay. He admitted this himself
with singular candour: “In intestine quarrels,” he writes to
Cicero, “as long as one struggles by legal means, and without
having recourse to arms, one ought to attach oneself to the
most honourable party; but when one comes to war it is
necessary to turn towards the stronger, and regard the
safest party as the best.”<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c013'><sup>[208]</sup></a> From the moment that he was
satisfied with simply comparing the strength of the two
rivals, his choice became easier; in order to decide it was
enough to open his eyes. On one side there were eleven
legions, supported by tried auxiliaries, and commanded by
the greatest general of the republic, ranged on the frontiers,
and ready to open the campaign at the first signal;<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c013'><sup>[209]</sup></a> on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>other, few or no trained troops, but a great number of
young men of illustrious families as incapable of commanding
as they were little disposed to obey, and many of those
great names that honour a party more than they help it;
on one side, military rule and the discipline of a camp; on
the other, quarrels, disputes, resentments, rival authorities,
differences of opinion, in short, all the inconvenient habits
of civil life transported into a camp. These are the ordinary
difficulties of a party that claims to defend liberty, for it is
difficult to impose silence on people who fight to preserve
the right of free speech, and all authority quickly becomes
suspected when men have taken up arms to oppose an abuse
of authority. But it was the character of the two chiefs,
more than anything else, that made the difference between
the two parties. Caesar appeared to all the world, even to
his greatest enemies, a prodigy of activity and foresight.
As to Pompey it was clearly seen that he committed only
faults, and it was not any easier then than it is now to explain
his conduct. The war had not taken him unawares; he told
Cicero that he had foreseen it for a long time.<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c013'><sup>[210]</sup></a> There was
no great difficulty in foreseeing it, he had appeared to wish
for it; Caesar’s proposals had been rejected by his advice,
and the majority of the senate did nothing without consulting
him. He had, then, seen the crisis approaching from
afar, and during all that long diplomatic war which preceded
actual hostilities he had had the time necessary to prepare
himself. Every one, therefore, believed that he was ready,
although nothing showed it. When he said, with his usual
boastfulness, that he had only to stamp his foot to bring up
legions, it was supposed he meant to speak of secret levies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>or of alliances not generally known, that at the last moment
would bring him troops. His confidence restored courage
to the most terror-stricken. In truth, such a strange self-confidence
in the midst of such real danger, in a man who
had conquered kingdoms, and conducted great affairs, passes
our comprehension.</p>

<p class='c014'>Whence then could this confidence come to Pompey?
Had he no exact information of the strength of his enemy?
did he really believe, as he said, that his troops were discontented,
his generals unfaithful, and that no one would
follow him in the war he was going to wage against his
country? or did he reckon on the good fortune of his
earlier years, on the prestige of his name, on the happy
chances that had given him so many victories? It is
certain that, at the moment when the veterans of Alesia
and Gergovia were assembling at Ravenna, and approaching
the Rubicon, Pompey imprudently exhibited a great
disdain for the general and for his troops, <i><span lang="la">vehementer contemnebat
hunc hominem!</span></i><a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c013'><sup>[211]</sup></a> But this foolish boasting did
not last long; on the news that Caesar was marching
resolutely on Rome, it ceased at once, and this same man
whom Cicero showed us just now disdaining his rival and
predicting his defeat, he shows us a few days later, terrified
and flying into the depths of Apulia without daring to halt
or make a stand anywhere. We have the letter that
Pompey then wrote to the consuls, and to Domitius, who
attempted at least to hold out in Corfinium: “Know, he
tells them, that I am in great uneasiness (<i><span lang="la">scitote me esse in
summa sollicitudine</span></i>”).<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c013'><sup>[212]</sup></a> What a contrast to the over-confident
words of just now! This is just the tone of a man
who, waking up with a start from exaggerated hopes, passes
suddenly from one extreme to another. He had prepared
nothing because he had been too well assured of success; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>dared undertake nothing because he was too certain of failure.
He has no confidence or hope in any one; all resistance
seems to him useless; he does not even count upon the
awakening of a patriotic spirit, and it does not occur to
him to make an appeal to the republican youth of the
Italian municipia. At each step that his enemy takes in
advance, he retreats still farther. Brundusium itself, with
its strong walls, does not give him confidence; he thinks of
quitting Italy, and does not believe that he is safe until he
has put the sea between himself and Caesar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Caelius had not waited so long to take a side. Even
before the struggle commenced it was easy for him to
see where the superior strength lay and on which side
victory would be. He had then boldly faced about and
put himself in the front rank among Caesar’s friends.
He took his side openly when he supported with his usual
vigour the proposition of Calidius, who demanded that
Pompey should be sent back to his province of Spain.
When the hope of peace was completely lost, he left Rome
with his friends Curio and Dolabella, and went to join
Caesar at Ravenna. He followed him in his triumphal
march through Italy; he saw him pardon Domitius, who
had been taken in Corfinium, pursue Pompey, and shut
him up closely in Brundusium. In the intoxication of these
rapid successes he wrote to Cicero: “Have you ever seen
a man more foolish than your Pompey, who brings us into
such great troubles, and whose conduct is so childish? On
the other hand, have you ever read or heard of anything
that surpasses the ardour of Caesar in action and his
moderation in victory? What do you think of our soldiers,
who, in the depth of winter, notwithstanding the difficulties
of a wild and frozen country, have finished the war in an
unopposed march?”<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c013'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>When Caelius had once decided, his only thought was to
draw Cicero after him. He knew that he could do nothing
more agreeable to Caesar. Victorious though he was,
Caesar, who did not delude himself about those who served
him, felt that he wanted a few honest men to give his party
a better appearance. The great name of Cicero would
have sufficed to correct the bad impression that the character
of those about him produced. Unfortunately it was very
difficult to get Cicero to decide. From the day when the
Rubicon was passed till the capture of Brundusium he
wavered and changed his mind every day. Both sides
were equally anxious to secure him, and the two chiefs
themselves approached him, but in a very different manner.
Pompey, always bungling, wrote him short and imperious
letters: “Take the Appian road as soon as possible, come
and join me at Luceria, at Brundusium, there you will be
safe.”<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c013'><sup>[214]</sup></a> Strange language in the vanquished who persists
in speaking as a superior! Caesar was much more judicious:
“Come, he says to him, come and aid me with your
counsel, your name, and your glory!”<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c013'><sup>[215]</sup></a> This consideration,
these advances from a victorious general, who humbly
solicited when he had the right to command, could not fail
to influence Cicero. At the same time, to be more sure of
gaining him over, Caesar got his dearest friends to write to
him, Oppius, Balbus, Trebatius, and especially Caelius, who
knew so well how to approach him. They attacked him on
all his weak sides at once; they revived his old grudges
against Pompey; they moved him by the picture of the
misfortunes that threatened his family; they excited his
vanity by pointing out to him the honour of reconciling
parties and pacifying the republic.</p>

<p class='c014'>So many assaults were bound to end by shaking a mind
so undecided. At the last moment, he resolved to remain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>in Italy, in some isolated country house or in some neutral
town, living apart from public affairs, not siding with any
one, but preaching moderation and peace to all. Already
he had begun an eloquent treatise on peace among citizens;
he wished to finish it at leisure, and, as he had a good
opinion of his eloquence, he hoped it would cause the most
stubborn to lay down their arms. It was an idle fancy,
no doubt; but we must not forget that Cato, who is
beyond suspicion, regretted that Cicero had given up his
plan so soon. He blamed him for going to Pharsalia,
where his presence was not a great assistance to the combatants,
while, by remaining neutral, he could preserve his
influence over the two rivals and serve as intermediary
between them. But one single day overturned all these
fine projects. When Pompey quitted Brundusium, where
he did not think he was safe, and embarked for Greece,
Caesar, who counted upon this news to retain Cicero,
hastened to transmit it to him. It was precisely this that
made him change his mind. He was not one of those men
who, like Caelius, turn with fortune and decide for success.
On the contrary, he felt himself drawn to Pompey as soon
as he saw him unfortunate. “I have never desired to
share in his prosperity, said he; I could wish to share his
misfortune!”<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c013'><sup>[216]</sup></a> When he knew that the republican army
had departed, and with it almost all his old political friends;
when he felt that on that Italian soil there were no longer
magistrates, consuls or senate, he was seized with profound
grief; it seemed that there was a blank around him, and
that the sun itself, according to his expression, had disappeared
from the world. Many people came to congratulate
him on his prudence, but he reproached himself with it
as a crime. He bitterly accused his weakness, his age, his
love of repose and of peace. He had but one thought, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>leave as quickly as possible. “I cannot support my regret,
he said; my books, my studies, my philosophy are of no
use to me. I am like a bird that wishes to fly away, and I
always look seawards.”<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c013'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>From that time his resolution was taken. Caelius tried
in vain to retain him at the last moment, by a touching
letter, in which he spoke to him of the probable loss of his
fortune, and of the danger of jeopardizing the future of
his son. Cicero, although he was much moved, was
content to reply with a firmness unusual with him: “I am
glad to see that you are so anxious for my son; but, if the
republic continues, he will always be rich enough with his
father’s name; if it must perish, he will suffer the common
fate of all the citizens.”<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c013'><sup>[218]</sup></a> And, soon after, he crossed the
sea to repair to Pompey’s camp. Not that he counted
upon success; in joining a party whose weaknesses he was
acquainted with, he well knew that he was going voluntarily
to take his share in a disaster. “I come, said he, like
Amphiaraüs to cast myself alive into the abyss.”<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c013'><sup>[219]</sup></a> It was
a sacrifice that he thought he ought to make for his country,
and it is proper to give him so much the more credit for it
as he did it without illusions and without hope.</p>

<p class='c014'>While Cicero thus went to rejoin Pompey, Caelius
accompanied Caesar to Spain. All relations became henceforth
impossible between them; consequently their correspondence,
which had until then been very active, stops
from this moment. There remains, however, one letter,
the last that passed between them, and which forms a
strange contrast to those that precede. Caelius addressed
it to Cicero a few months only after the events that I have
just spoken of, but under very different circumstances.
Although it has only come down to us very mutilated, and
it is not easy to restore the sense of all the phrases, we see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>clearly that the writer was a prey to violent irritation.
This zealous partisan of Caesar, who sought to convert
others to his opinion, has suddenly become a furious enemy;
that cause that he lately defended with so much warmth, he
now only calls a detestable cause, and thinks “it is better
to die than remain on that side.”<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c013'><sup>[220]</sup></a> What had happened,
then, in the interval? What motives had led Caelius to
this last change, and what was the result of it? It is well
to relate it, for the narrative may throw some light on the
policy of the dictator, and above all make us acquainted
with those about him.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>III.</h4>

<p class='c015'>In his treatise, <cite><span lang="la">De Amicitia</span></cite>, Cicero affirms that a tyrant
cannot have friends.<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c013'><sup>[221]</sup></a> In speaking thus he was thinking of
Caesar, and it must be admitted that this example seems
to justify him. Courtiers are not wanting when a man is
master, and Caesar, who paid them well, had more than
any other, but we know of scarcely any sincere and devoted
friends. Perhaps he had some among those obscure
servants whose memory history has not preserved,<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c013'><sup>[222]</sup></a> but
none of those whom he placed in the first rank, and whom
he invited to share in his good fortune, remained faithful to
him. His liberalities only brought him ingratitude, his
clemency disarmed no one, and he was betrayed by those
on whom he had lavished most favours. His soldiers alone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>can really be called his friends, those veterans who remained
from the great Gallic wars; his centurions, all of whom he
knew by name, and who let themselves bravely be killed
for him under his eyes: that Scaeva, who at Dyrrhachium
had his shield pierced with two hundred and thirty arrows;<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c013'><sup>[223]</sup></a>
that Crastinus, who said to him on the morning of Pharsalia,
“This evening you shall thank me dead or alive.”<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c013'><sup>[224]</sup></a> These
men served him faithfully, he knew them and relied upon
them; but he well knew that he could not trust his
generals. Although he had heaped money and honours
upon them after his victories, they were discontented. A
few, and those the most honourable, were grieved to think
that they had destroyed the republic and shed their blood
to establish absolute power. The greater number had not
these scruples, but all thought their services ill rewarded.
Caesar’s liberality, great as it was, had not sufficed to
satisfy them. The republic was delivered up to them, they
were praetors and consuls, they governed the richest
provinces, and yet they ceased not to complain. Everything
served them as a pretext for murmuring. Antony
had got Pompey’s house awarded to him at a low price;
when they came for the money he got in a passion and
only paid with insults. No doubt he thought that day that
they were wanting in respect for him, and called Caesar
ungrateful. It is not uncommon to see those warriors, so
brave before the enemy, and so admirable on the day of
battle, become again in private life vulgarly ambitious,
full of base jealousy and insatiable greed. They began by
murmuring and complaining; they almost all ended by
betraying him. Among those who killed Caesar were found
perhaps his best generals, Sulpicius Galba, the conqueror
of the Nantuates, Basilus, one of his most brilliant cavalry
officers, Decimus Brutus and Trebonius, the heroes of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>siege of Marseilles. Those who were not in the plot did
not conduct themselves any better that day. When we
read in Plutarch the narrative of the death of Caesar, our
heart bleeds at seeing that no one tried to defend him.
The conspirators were only about sixty in number, and
there were more than eight hundred senators. The greater
number among them had served in his army; all owed to
him the honour of sitting in the curia, of which they were
not worthy, and these wretches, who held their fortune and
their dignity from him, who begged for his protection and
lived on his favours, saw him killed without saying a word.
All the time this horrible struggle lasted, while, “like a
beast attacked by the hunters, he strove among the swords
drawn against him,” they remained motionless on their
seats, and all their courage consisted in flying when Brutus,
beside the bleeding corpse, essayed to speak. Cicero recalled
this scene, of which he had been a witness, when he said
later, “It is on the day when the oppressors of their country
fall that we see clearly that they have no friends.”<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c013'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>When Caesar’s generals, who had so many motives for
remaining faithful to him, betrayed him, could he reckon
more on those doubtful allies that he had recruited on the
Forum, and who before serving him had served all parties?
To accomplish his designs he had need of politicians; in
order that the new government should not appear to be a
wholly military rule he had need of the greatest number
possible. Therefore he was not squeamish, he took them
without selection. It was the dishonest men of all parties
that came to him by preference. He received them well,
although he esteemed them little, and carried them everywhere
in his train. Cicero had been very much afraid of
them when Caesar came with them to see him at Formiae:
“There is not a rascal in all Italy,” said he, “who is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>with him,”<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c013'><sup>[226]</sup></a> and Atticus, usually so reserved, could not
help calling this retinue an infernal troop.<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c013'><sup>[227]</sup></a> However
habituated we may be to see the initiative in such revolutions
taken by men who have not much to lose, there is reason,
nevertheless, to be surprised that Caesar did not find a few
more honourable allies. Even those who are most opposed
to him are compelled to recognize that much which he
wished to destroy did not deserve preservation. The
revolution that he contemplated had profound causes, it
was natural that it should have also sincere partisans.
How does it happen then that, among those who aided
him to change a government of which many complained,
and from which every one had suffered, there are so few
who seem to act from conviction, and that almost all, on
the contrary, are only paid conspirators working without
sincerity for a man whom they do not love, and for a
purpose that they consider bad?</p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps we must explain the composition of Caesar’s
party by the means that he usually took to recruit it. We do
not see that when he wished to gain any one over to his
cause he lost his time in demonstrating to him the defects
of the old government and the merits of that by which he
wished to replace it. He employed more simple and sure
arguments: he paid. This showed that he knew well the
men of his time, and he was not deceived in thinking that,
in a society altogether given up to luxury and pleasure,
weakened beliefs only left room for self-interest. He
organized then without scruple a vast system of corruption.
Gaul furnished the means. He pillaged it as vigorously as
he had conquered it, “seizing,” says Suetonius, “all that
he found in the temples of the gods, and taking towns by
assault, less to punish them than to have a pretext for
plundering them.”<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c013'><sup>[228]</sup></a> With this money he made himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>partisans. Those who came to see him never went away
empty-handed. He did not even neglect to make presents
to the slaves and freedmen who had any influence over their
masters. While he was absent from Rome, the clever
Spaniard Balbus and the banker Oppius, who were his
agents, distributed bounties in his name; they discreetly
helped embarrassed senators; they became the treasurers
of young men of high family who had exhausted the
paternal resources. They lent money without interest,
but the services by which they would have to repay the
loans were well known to every one. It was thus they
bought Curio, who set a high price on himself; he was in
debt for more than 60,000,000 sesterces (£480,000).
Caelius and Dolabella, whose affairs were in a not much
better state, were probably gained by the same means.
Never was corruption practised on a greater scale and
displayed with more impudence. Almost every year,
during the winter, Caesar returned to Cisalpine Gaul with
the treasures of the Gauls. Then the market was opened,
and the great personages arrived one after another. One
day, at Lucca, so many came at once that two hundred
senators were counted in the apartments, and one hundred
and twenty lictors at the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>In general, the fidelity of people who are bought does
not last much longer than the money they receive; now, in
their hands, money does not last long, and the day one
tires of providing for their prodigality, one is obliged to
begin to distrust them. There was besides, in the case
of all these political friends of Caesar, a special reason
why, one day or other, they should become discontented.
They had grown up amidst the storms of the republic;
they had thrown themselves early into that active and
bustling life, and they had acquired the taste for it. No
men more than they, had used and abused liberty of speech;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>to it they owed their influence, their power, and their
renown. By a strange inconsistency, these men, who
worked with all their might to establish an absolute government,
were those who could least do without the struggles
of public life, the turmoil of business, and the excitement
of the rostrum, that is to say just those things which exist
only under free governments. There were no men who
would sooner find despotic power burdensome than those
who had not been able to support even the light and
equitable yoke of the law. Accordingly they were not
long in perceiving the error they had committed. They
soon found out that in aiding a master to destroy the
liberty of others, they had delivered up their own. At the
same time it was easy for them to see that the new
government that they had established with their own hands
could not give them what the old one had given them.
What, in fact, were those dignities and those honours with
which it was pretended to reward them, when one man
alone possessed real power? There were, no doubt, still
praetors and consuls; but what comparison could be made
between these magistrates, dependent on one man, subject
to his caprices, dominated by his authority, overshadowed,
and, as it were, obliterated by his glory, and those of the
old republic? So then must inevitably arise mistakes,
regrets, and often also treasons. This is why those allies
whom Caesar had recruited in the different political parties,
after having been very useful to him, all finished by causing
him great trouble. None of those restless and intractable
minds, undisciplined by nature and habit, had willingly
consented to submit to discipline, or heartily resigned himself
to obey. As soon as they were no longer under the eye of
the master and restrained by his powerful hand, the old
instincts in them gained the upper hand; they became
again, on the first opportunity, seditious as before, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>though Rome had been pacified by absolute power, troubles
recommenced every time Caesar was absent. It is thus
that Caelius, Dolabella, and Antony compromised the
public tranquillity they had been charged to maintain.
Curio, the head of that youth that rallied round the new
government, died too soon to have had the time to be discontented;
but we may conjecture, from the light and flippant
manner in which he already spoke of Caesar in his private
conversation, from the small degree of illusion he seemed
to have about him, that he would have acted like the rest.<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c013'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>It is easy now to understand what reasons Caelius had to
complain, and how that ambition which the dignities of the
old republic had not satisfied at last found itself ill at ease
under the new government. The strange letter that he
wrote to Cicero, and that declaration of war which he
made to Caesar and his party are now explained. He
had early become discontented. From the very beginning
of the civil war, when he was congratulated on the
success of his party, he answered gloomily: “What do I
care about that glory which never reaches to me?”<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c013'><sup>[230]</sup></a> The
truth is that he was beginning to understand that there was
only room for one man in the new government, and that
he alone for the future would have glory as well as power.
Caesar took him on his expedition to Spain without giving
him, it appears, an opportunity of distinguishing himself.
On his return to Rome he was appointed praetor, but he
did not have the urban praetorship which was the most
honourable, and Trebonius was preferred to him. This
preference, which he regarded as an insult, caused him
great vexation. He resolved to revenge himself, and only
waited for an opportunity. He thought it had come when
he saw Caesar set out with all his troops for Thessaly, in
pursuit of Pompey. He thought that in the absence of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>dictator and his soldiers, in the midst of the excitement of
Italy, where a thousand contradictory rumours on the result
of the struggle were circulating, he might attempt a decisive
stroke. The moment was well chosen; but what was still
better chosen was the question on which Caelius resolved
to begin the fight. Nothing does more credit to his political
ability than to have so clearly discerned the weak sides of
the victorious party, and to have seen at a glance the best
position he could take up for a successful attack upon it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although Caesar was master of Rome and of Italy, and
it was seen that the republican army would not check him,
he still had great difficulties to surmount. Caelius knew
this well; he knew well that in political struggles success
is often an ordeal full of danger. After the enemy has been
vanquished one’s own friends have to be provided for, a
task which is often troublesome. That greed must be resisted
which has hitherto been tolerated, or even encouraged,
when the time to satisfy it seemed distant; it is necessary
above all to defend oneself against the exaggerated hopes
that victory produces in those who have gained it, and
which yet cannot be realized. Usually, when one belongs
to the weaker party and wishes to gain adherents, promises
are not spared; but when one reaches power it is very
difficult to keep all the engagements that have been made,
and those fine programmes that have been accepted and
scattered abroad become then a source of great embarrassment.
Caesar was the recognized chief of the democratic
party; thence came his strength. We remember
that he had said, on entering Italy, that he came to restore
liberty to the republic which was enslaved by a handful of
aristocrats. Now, the democratic party of which he thus
proclaimed himself the representative had its programme
ready prepared. It was not exactly that of the Gracchi.
After a century of often bloody struggles, hatred had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>become envenomed, and the senseless resistance of the
aristocracy had made the people more exacting. Each of
the chiefs who, since Caius Gracchus, had come forward to
lead them, had formulated for them some fresh demand
the more surely to draw them after him. Clodius had aimed
at establishing the unlimited right of association and of
governing the republic by secret societies. Catiline promised
confiscation and pillage; accordingly his memory had
remained very popular. Cicero speaks of the funeral
banquets which were celebrated in his honour, and of the
flowers that his tomb was covered with.<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c013'><sup>[231]</sup></a> Caesar, who
presented himself as their successor, could not altogether
repudiate their heritage; he must promise that he would
finish their work and satisfy the wishes of the democracy.
At this moment the democracy did not appear to care
much about political reforms; what it wanted was a social
revolution. To be fed in idleness at the expense of the
state, by means of gratuitous distributions very frequently
repeated; to appropriate the best lands of the allies by
sending colonies into the richest Italian cities; to arrive at
a sort of division of property, under pretext of recovering
from the aristocracy the public domain which it had
appropriated, such was the ordinary idea of the plebeians;
but what they most urgently demanded, what had become
the watchword of all this party, was the abolition of debts,
or, as they said, the destruction of the registers of the
creditors (<i><span lang="la">tabulae novae</span></i>), that is to say, the authorized
violation of public faith, and a general bankruptcy decreed
by the law. This programme, violent as it was, Caesar had
prepared to accept in proclaiming himself the head of the
democracy. As long as the struggle was doubtful, he took
care to make no reservations, for fear of weakening his
party by divisions. Therefore it was thought that as soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>as he was victorious he would set himself to work to
realize it.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Caesar had not only come to destroy a government,
he wished to found another, and he knew very well that
nothing solid can be established on spoliation and bankruptcy.
After having used, without compunction, the
programme of the democracy to overturn the republic, he
understood that he would have to take up a new part. On
the day that he became master of Rome, his statesman’s
instinct, and his interest as a sovereign made him a conservative.
While he extended his hand to the moderate
men of the old parties, he had no scruple in often returning
to the traditions of the old government.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is certain that the work of Caesar, taking it altogether,
is far from being that of a revolutionary; some of his laws
were praised by Cicero after the Ides of March; which is
as much as to say that they were not conformable to the
wishes and hopes of the democracy. He sent eighty
thousand poor citizens into the colonies, but over sea, to
Africa and to Greece. He could not think of altogether
abolishing the donations made by the State to the citizens
of Rome, but he diminished them. In the place of the three
hundred and twenty thousand citizens who shared in these
under the republic, he only admitted a hundred and fifty
thousand; he ordered that this number should not be
exceeded, and that every year the praetor should fill up
the place of those persons, thus privileged by poverty, who
had died within the year. Far from changing anything in
the prohibitive regulations that were in force under the
republic, he established import duties on foreign merchandise.
He promulgated a sumptuary law, much more severe
than the preceding, which regulated in detail the manner
in which people should dress and live, and had it executed
with tyrannical rigour. The markets were guarded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>soldiers lest anything should be sold that the law forbade,
and the soldiers were authorized to enter houses and
seize prohibited food even on the tables. Caesar had
taken these measures, which hampered commerce and
industry, and consequently were hurtful to the interests of
the people, from the traditions of the aristocratic governments.
They could not therefore be popular; but the
restriction he put upon the right of meeting was still less
so. This right, to which the democracy clung more than
to any other, had been respected even to the last days of
the republic, and the tribune Clodius had skilfully used it
to frighten the senate and to terrorize the Forum. Under
pretext of honouring the tutelar deities of each cross-way,
associations of the districts (<i><span lang="la">collegia compitalicia</span></i>), comprising
the poor citizens and the slaves, had been formed. Beginning
by being religious, these societies soon became
political. In the time of Clodius they formed a sort of
regular army of the democracy, and played the same part
in the riots of Rome as the “sections” in ’93 did among
us. By the side of these permanent associations, and on
the same model, temporary associations were formed, every
time a great election took place. The people were enrolled
by districts, they were divided into decuries and centuries;
chiefs, who led them to vote in military order, were appointed;
and as in general the people did not give their
votes for nothing, an important person named <i><span lang="la">sequester</span></i> was
appointed beforehand, in whose hands the sum promised
by the candidate was deposited, and distributors (<i><span lang="la">divisores</span></i>)
charged, after the voting, to divide it among each tribe.
This is how universal suffrage was exercised in Rome towards
the close of the republic, and thus this race, naturally
inclined to discipline, had succeeded in giving an organization
to disorder. Caesar, who had often made use of these
secret associations, who by them had managed elections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>and dominated the deliberations of the Forum, would no
longer suffer them when he had no longer need of them.
He thought that a regular government would not last long
if he allowed this underground government to work by its
side. He did not shrink then from severe measures to rid
himself of this organized disorder. To the great scandal
of his friends, he suppressed, at a single stroke, all the
political societies, only allowing the most ancient, which
presented no danger, to continue in existence.</p>

<p class='c014'>These were vigorous measures, and such as must have
offended many people; accordingly he did not venture
to take them till late, after Munda and Thapsus, when
his authority was no longer disputed and he felt himself
strong enough to resist the democracy, his ancient
ally. When he set out for Pharsalia he had still to observe
much caution; prudence commanded him not to displease
his friends, while so many enemies remained. Moreover,
there were certain questions which could not be deferred,
so important were they in the eyes of the democracy which
demanded their immediate settlement. One of the chief
of these was the abolition of debts. Caesar turned his
attention to it immediately on his return from Spain; but
here again, notwithstanding the difficulties of his position,
he was not so radical as he was expected to be. Placed
between his conservative instincts and the demands of his
friends, he adopted a middle course: instead of abolishing
the debts completely, he contented himself with reducing
them. Firstly, he ordered that all sums paid up to that
time as interest should be deducted from the capital sums;
then, to make payment of the amount thus reduced easier,
he ruled that the property of the debtors should be valued
by arbitrators; that they should assess it, not at its
present value, but at that which it had before the civil
war, and that the creditors should be obliged to take it at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>that rate. Suetonius says that, in this manner, debts
were reduced by more than one-fourth. These measures
certainly still appear to us sufficiently revolutionary. We
cannot approve this intervention of authority, to despoil
without reason private persons of a part of their wealth,
and nothing can seem to us more unjust than that the law
itself should annul contracts which have been placed under
its protection; but at that time the effect produced on men’s
minds was very different. The creditors, who had feared
that nothing would be left them, thought themselves very
fortunate not to lose all, and the debtors, who had reckoned
upon being altogether freed, bitterly complained because
they were still required to pay part. Hence disappointment
and murmuring. “At this moment,” wrote Caelius,
“with the exception of a few usurers, everybody herd
is Pompeian.”<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c013'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>This was a good opportunity for a secret enemy like
Caelius. He hastened to seize it, and to take advantage
of the disaffection which he clearly perceived. His tactics
were bold. The plan which he devised was to take upon
himself this character of advanced democrat, or, as we
should say now, of socialist, which Caesar rejected, to form
a more radical party of all these malcontents, and to declare
himself their head. While the arbitrators appointed to
value the property of the debtors performed their delicate
functions to the best of their ability, and the praetor
of the city, Trebonius, settled the disputes which arose
upon their decisions, Caelius had his curule chair placed
beside the tribunal of Trebonius, and setting himself up,
by his own authority, as judge of the sentences of his
colleague, he declared that he would support the demands
of those who had any complaints; but whether it was that
Trebonius satisfied everybody, or rather, that they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>afraid of Caesar, no one dared to come forward. This first
check did not discourage Caelius: he thought, on the
contrary, that the more difficult his position became, the
more necessary it was to put a bold face on the matter, and
therefore, notwithstanding the opposition of the consul
Servilius, and of all the other magistrates, he published two
very daring laws, one remitting a year’s rent to all tenants,
the other abolishing entirely all debts. This time the
people seemed disposed to come to the aid of him who
took their part so resolutely; disturbances took place;
blood was shed as in former times in the Forum; Trebonius,
attacked by a furious multitude, was thrown down from his
tribunal and only escaped by a miracle. Caelius triumphed,
and no doubt thought that a new revolution was about to
commence; but, by a singular coincidence, he soon found
himself the victim of the same error that later ruined Brutus.
In causes quite opposed, these two men so unlike each
other deceived themselves in the same manner: both had
reckoned too much on the people of Rome. One restored
them liberty, and thought them capable of desiring and
defending it, the other called them to arms, promising to
share among them the wealth of the rich; but the people
listened neither to the one nor the other, for they were no
more powerfully stirred by evil passions than by noble sentiments;
they had played their part and they were aware of
it. On the day that they had surrendered themselves to
absolute power they seem to have lost entirely all memory
of the past. From that time we see that they have renounced
all political activity, and nothing can rouse them
from their apathy. Those rights, which they had desired
with such ardour, and gained with so much trouble, that
greed so carefully encouraged by the popular leaders, even
the tribunate and the agrarian laws, all become indifferent
to them. They are already that populace of the empire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>which is so admirably painted by Tacitus, the most worthless
of all peoples, cringing to the successful, cruel to the
defeated, welcoming all who triumph with the same applause,
whose sole part in all revolutions consists in joining the
train of the conqueror, when the struggle is over.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such a people could not be a real support to anybody,
and Caelius was wrong to reckon upon them. If, by force
of habit, they appeared one day to be moved by those great
promises which had stirred them so often, when they were
free, the feeling was but a passing one, and a small body
of cavalry which chanced to be marching through Rome
was sufficient to reduce them to order. The consul
Servilius was armed by the senate with the famous formula
which suspended all legal powers, and concentrated authority
in a single hand. Aided by these passing troops,
he forbade Caelius to exercise the functions of his office,
and when Caelius resisted, he had his curule chair broken,<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c013'><sup>[233]</sup></a>
and dragged him from the tribune from which he would not
descend. This time the people remained quiet, not a voice
answered when he tried to awaken the old passions in these
dead souls. Caelius went home with rage in his heart.
After such a public disgrace it was not possible to remain
longer in Rome. Accordingly he hastened to quit it, telling
everybody that he was going to have an explanation with
Caesar; but he had quite other projects. Since Rome
abandoned him, Caelius was going to attempt to rouse Italy
and recommence the social war. It was a bold enterprise,
and yet with the help of an intrepid man whose support he
had procured he did not despair of success. There was at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>that time in Italy an old conspirator, Milo, who had made
himself dreaded by his violence during the anarchy which
followed Cicero’s consulship, and when condemned later
for assassination, he had taken refuge at Marseilles. Caesar,
in recalling all the exiles, had excepted this man whose
incorrigible audacity he feared; but, on the invitation of
Caelius, he had secretly returned and awaited the turn of
events. Caelius went to see him, and both wrote pressing
letters to the free towns of Italy, making them great
promises, and exciting them to take up arms. The free
towns remained quiet. Caelius and Milo were forced to
make use of the last resource that remained to them.
Abandoned by the free citizens of Rome, and of Italy,
they appealed to the servile population, opening the prisons
of the slaves, and calling upon the shepherds of Apulia
and the gladiators of the public games. When they had
by these means got together some partisans, they parted to
tempt fortune separately, but neither succeeded. Milo,
who had dared to attack an important town defended by a
praetor with a legion, was killed by a stone. Caelius, after
having vainly essayed to induce Naples and Campania to
declare in his favour, was obliged to retreat to Thurium.
There he met some Spanish and Gallic cavalry who had
been sent from Rome, and as he advanced to speak with
them and promised them money if they would follow him,
they killed him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus perished at the age of thirty-four years this intrepid
young man who had hoped to equal the fortunes of Caesar.
Never had such vast designs so miserable an end. After
having shown an incredible audacity, and formed projects
which grew more and more bold as the first attempts failed;
after having in a few months successively tried to raise the
people of Rome, Italy, and the slaves, he died obscurely
by the hand of some barbarians whom he wished to induce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>to betray their duty; and his death, happening at the
moment when all eyes were fixed on Pharsalia, passed
almost unobserved. Who would dare to say, however, that
this end, sad as it may be, was not deserved? Was it not
just, after all, that a man who had lived by adventures
should perish as an adventurer? He was not a consummate
politician, whatever Cicero may assert; he failed to
be that, because he lacked conviction and a genuine devotion.
The instability of his feelings, the inconsistency of
his conduct, that sort of scepticism that he affected for all
convictions were not less hurtful to his talents than to his
character. If he had known how to put greater unity into
his life, if he had early attached himself to some honourable
party, his capacities, finding employment worthy of them,
would have attained their perfection. He might have no
doubt failed, but to die at Pharsalia or Philippi is still considered
an honour by posterity. On the contrary, as he
changed his opinions as often as his interests or caprices, as
he served by turns the most opposite parties without belief
in the justice of any, he was never anything but an immature
orator and a hap-hazard politician, and he died on the high-road
like a common malefactor. However, notwithstanding
his faults, history has some difficulty in judging him harshly.
The ancient writers never speak of him without a secret
liking. The brilliancy that surrounded his youth, the
charms of his mind, the elegance which he knew how to
preserve in his worst disorders, a sort of daring frankness
which prevented him seeking honourable pretexts for dishonourable
actions, his clear judgment of political situations,
his knowledge of men, his fertility of resource, his strength
of resolution, his boldness in daring all and in constantly
risking his life; these many brilliant qualities though mingled
with so many great defects have disarmed the most severe
judges. The sage Quintilian himself, little fitted as he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>to understand that passionate nature, dared not be severe
upon him. After having praised the graces of his mind
and his incisive eloquence, he contented himself with saying,
by way of moral: “He was a man who deserved to have
had a juster sense of conduct and a longer life, <i><span lang="la">dignus
vir cui mens melior et vita longior contigisset!</span></i>”<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c013'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>At the time that Caelius died, that elegant youth of which
he was the model, and which the verses of Catullus and the
letters of Cicero have helped us to know, had already partly
disappeared. There remained scarcely any of those young
men who had shone in the <i><span lang="fr">fêtes</span></i> of Baiae and who had been
applauded in the Forum. Catullus died first, at the very
moment when his talents were being ripened by age, and
were becoming more serious and more elevated. His friend
Calvus was soon to follow him, carried off at thirty-five, no
doubt by the fatigues of public life. Curio had been killed
by Pompey’s soldiers, as Caelius was by Caesar’s. Dolabella
survived, but only for a short time, and he also
was to perish in a tragic manner. It was a revolutionary
generation which the revolution mowed down, for it is
true, according to the celebrated saying, that in all times as
in all countries revolution devours her own children.</p>

“After our time, there will be great debates about you, as
there have been among ourselves.”<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c013'><sup>[235]</sup></a> It is certain that he is

something in him to justify both the one and the other.
He cannot be admired or blamed without some reservations,
and he always attracts on some side those whom he repels

<p class='c014'>The more complex and disputable his character, the
more necessary it is, in order to form a just idea of him,
to interrogate those who were in a position to know him.
Although Cicero was almost all his life separated from Caesar
by grave disagreements, twice he had occasion to maintain
a close intercourse with him: during the Gallic war he was
his political ally and his assiduous correspondent; after
Pharsalia he became his friend again, and acted as intermediary
between the conqueror and those he had condemned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>to exile. Let us inquire what he says of him at
these two periods of his life when he saw him most closely,
and let us collect from his correspondence, through which
we become so well acquainted with the eminent men of that
time, the information it contains about him who was the
greatest of all.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>I.</h4>

<p class='c015'>I must first recall the events which led Cicero to desert
the aristocratic party to which he had been attached since
his consulship, in order to serve the triumvirs, and how the
courageous friend of Hortensius and of Cato became so
subservient to Pompey and Caesar. It is not an honourable
period in his life, and his most convinced admirers say as
little about it as possible. However, there is some interest,
perhaps even some profit, in pausing upon it for a moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero’s return from the exile to which he had been condemned
after his consulship by the efforts of Clodius, was
a veritable triumph. Brundusium, where he disembarked,
celebrated his arrival by public rejoicings. All the citizens
of the free towns that bordered the Appian Way, waited for
him on the road, and the heads of families with their
wives and children came from all the neighbouring farms
to see him pass. At Rome, he was received by an
immense multitude crowded on the public squares, or
ranged on the steps of the temples. “It seemed,” said
he, “that all the city was drawn from its foundations to
come and salute its liberator.”<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c013'><sup>[236]</sup></a> At his brother’s house,
where he was going to live, he found the most eminent
members of the senate awaiting him, and at the same time
congratulatory addresses from all the popular societies of
the city. It is probable that some who had signed these,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>had voted with the same eagerness the preceding year for
the law that exiled him, and that many clapped their hands
on his return who had applauded his departure; but the
people have occasionally these strange and generous impulses.
It sometimes happens that they break away by a
sudden bound from the malice, distrust, and narrowness of
party spirit, and, at the very moment when passions seem
most inflamed and divisions most clearly marked, they
unite all at once to render homage to some great genius or
to some great character, which, we know not how, has compelled
their recognition. Usually, this gratitude and admiration
last but a short time; but, should they endure only
a day, they do eternal honour to him who has been their
object, and the glory they leave behind is sufficient to
illumine a whole life. Therefore we must pardon Cicero
for having spoken so often and with so much effusiveness
of this glorious day. A little pride was here both legitimate
and natural. How could a soul so sensitive to popular
applause have resisted the intoxication of a triumphal return?
“I do not feel as though I were simply returning from exile,”
said he, “I appear to myself to be mounting to heaven.”<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c013'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>But he was not long in descending again to earth. Whatever
he may have thought at first, he soon recognized that
this city which welcomed him with so much rejoicing was
not changed, and that he found it much the same as when
he left it. Anarchy had reigned there for three years, an
anarchy such as we have difficulty in imagining, notwithstanding
all the examples that our own revolutions have
given us. Since the triumvirs had let loose the rabble in
order to seize upon the government of the republic, it had
become entirely master. A daring tribune, a deserter from
the aristocracy, and one who bore the most illustrious name
in Rome, Clodius, had taken upon himself to lead it, and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>far as possible, to discipline it. He had displayed in this
difficult work many talents and much audacity, and had succeeded
well enough to deserve to become the terror of honest
people. When we speak of the Roman mob, we must not
forget that it was much more frightful than our own, and
was recruited from more formidable elements. Whatever
just dismay the populace that emerges all at once from the
lowest quarters of our manufacturing cities, on a day of
riot, may cause us, let us remember that at Rome, this
inferior social stratum descended still lower. Below the
vagabond strangers and the starving workmen, the ordinary
tools of revolutions, there was all that crowd of freedmen
demoralized by slavery, to whom liberty had given but one
more means for evil-doing; there were those gladiators,
trained to fight beast or man, who made light of the death
of others or themselves; there were, still lower, those fugitive
slaves, who were indeed the worst of all classes, who,
after having robbed or murdered at home, and lived by
pillage on the road, came from all Italy to take refuge and
disappear in the obscurity of the slums of Rome, an unclean
and terrible multitude of men without family, without
country, who, outlawed by the general sentiment of society,
had nothing to respect as they had nothing to lose. It
was among these that Clodius recruited his bands. Enlistments
were made in open day, in one of the most frequented
spots in Rome, near the Aurelian steps. The new soldiers
were then organized in decuries and centuries, under
energetic leaders. They assembled by districts in secret
societies, where they went to receive the password, and had
their centre and arsenal at the temple of Castor. When the
day arrived, and a popular manifestation was wanted, the
tribunes ordered the shops to be closed; then, the artisans
were thrown on the public streets, and all the army of the
secret societies marched together towards the Forum. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>they met, not the honest folks, who, feeling themselves the
weaker party, stayed at home, but the gladiators and herdsmen
whom the senate had fetched to defend them from the
wilds of Picenum or Gaul, and then the battle commenced.
“Imagine London,” says M. Mommsen, “with the slave
population of New Orleans, the police of Constantinople,
and the industrial condition of modern Rome, and think of
the political state of Paris in 1848: you will have some idea
of republican Rome in its last days.”</p>

<p class='c014'>No law was any longer respected, no citizen, no magistrate
was secure from violence. One day the fasces of a consul
were broken, the next a tribune was left for dead. The
senate itself, led away by these examples, had at last lost
that quality which Romans lost the last, its dignity. In
that assembly of kings, as a Greek had called it, they
debated with revolting coarseness. Cicero surprised no
one when he gave his adversaries the names of swine, filth,
rotten flesh. Sometimes the discussions became so heated
that the noise reached that excited crowd that filled the
porticoes near the curia, which then took part in them, with
so much violence that the terrified senators hastened to
fly.<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c013'><sup>[238]</sup></a> We can easily understand that it was much worse in
the Forum. Cicero relates that, when they were tired of
insulting, they spat in each other’s faces.<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c013'><sup>[239]</sup></a> When a man
wished to address the people, he had to take the rostrum
by storm, and he risked his life in trying to keep his place
there. The tribunes had found a new way of obtaining
unanimity of votes for the laws that they proposed: namely,
to beat and drive away all who took it into their heads not
to agree with them. But contests were nowhere more
violent than on the Campus Martius on election days.
Men were driven to regret the time when they trafficked
publicly in the votes of the electors. Now, they did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>even take the trouble to buy public offices; they found it
more convenient to seize them by force. Each party went
before daylight to the Campus Martius. Collisions took
place on the roads leading to it. Each party hastened to
arrive before its adversaries, or, if these were already established
there, attacked them in order to dislodge them:
naturally the appointments belonged to those who remained
masters of the place. In the midst of all these armed bands
there was no security for any one. Men were obliged to
fortify themselves in their houses for fear of being surprised.
They could only go out with a train of gladiators and slaves.
To go from one quarter of the city to another, they took as
many precautions as if they had to traverse a desert country,
and they met at the turning of a street with the same fear
they would have had at the corner of a wood. In the
midst of Rome there were real battles and regular sieges.
It was an ordinary manœuvre to set fire to the houses of
their enemies at the risk of burning down a whole quarter,
and, towards the end, no election or popular assembly took
place without bloodshed. “The Tiber,” says Cicero, speaking
of one of these combats, “was full of the corpses of the
citizens, the public sewers were choked with them, and
they were obliged to mop up with sponges the blood that
streamed from the Forum.”<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c013'><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Such were the obscure convulsions in which the Roman
republic perished, and the shameful disorders that sapped
its remaining strength. Cicero well knew that bloody anarchy
and the dangers he was about to run, and had therefore
resolved, before re-entering Rome, to be prudent, so as not
to run the risk of having to leave it again. His was not one
of those minds that misfortune strengthens, and that feel a
kind of pleasure in struggling against ill-fortune. Exile had
discouraged him. During the long weariness of his sojourn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>in Thessaly, he had made a sad review of the past. He had
reproached himself for his occasional courage and independence,
for his boldness in combating the powerful, and for
the mistake he had made in joining himself too closely to
the party which he had judged the best, but which was
evidently the weakest, as though to act thus had been a
crime. He came back thoroughly resolved to entangle
himself as little as possible with any one, to disarm his
enemies by concession, and to keep on good terms with
everybody. This was the course he followed on his arrival,
and his first speeches are masterpieces of policy. It is plain
that he still leans towards the aristocracy which had taken
an active part in his restoration, and to praise it he has
noble expressions of patriotism and gratitude; but already
he commences to flatter Caesar, and he calls Pompey “the
most virtuous, the wisest, the greatest of the men of his age
or of any age.”<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c013'><sup>[241]</sup></a> At the same time, he tells us himself, he
took good heed not to appear in the senate when irritating
questions were to be discussed, and was very careful to
escape from the Forum as soon as the debate became too
heated. “No more violent remedies,” he replied to those
who tried to urge him to some brilliant action; “I must put
myself on diet.”<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c013'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>However, he soon perceived that this adroit reserve was
not sufficient to ward off all danger. While he was rebuilding
his house on the Palatine, which had been destroyed after
his departure, the bands of Clodius threw themselves on the
workmen and dispersed them, and, emboldened by this
success, set fire to the house of his brother Quintus, which
was close by. A few days later, as he was walking on the
Via Sacra, he heard all at once a great noise, and on turning
round saw sticks raised and naked swords. It was the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>men who came to attack him. He had great difficulty in
escaping into the vestibule of a friendly house while his
slaves fought bravely before the door to give him time to
escape. Cato would not have been moved by this violence;
Cicero must have been very much frightened; above all it
taught him that his system of prudent reserve did not sufficiently
assure his safety. It was, in fact, probable that no
party would expose itself to defend him as long as he had
only compliments to give it, and as he could not stand alone
and without support in the midst of all these armed factions,
it was really necessary that, in order to find the support he
needed, he should consent to attach himself more closely to
one of them.</p>

<p class='c014'>But which should he choose? This was a grave question
in which his interests were at variance with his sympathies.
All his inclinations were evidently for the aristocracy. He
had closely attached himself to it about the time of his
consulship, and since that time he had professed to serve it,
and it was for it that he had just braved the anger of the
people and exposed himself to exile. But this very exile
had taught him how the most honourable course was also
the least safe. At the last moment, the senate had not
found better means of saving him than to make useless
decrees, to put on mourning, and go and throw themselves
at the feet of the consuls. Cicero thought that this was not
enough. Seeing himself so ill-defended, he had suspected
that people who did not take his interests in hand more
resolutely were not very sorry for his misfortunes; and
perhaps he was not wrong. The Roman aristocracy, whatever
he had done for it, could not forget he was a “new”
man. The Claudii, the Cornelii, the Manlii, always looked
with a certain displeasure on this insignificant townsman of
Arpinum, whom the popular vote had made their equal.
Still they might have pardoned his good fortune if he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>borne it with more modesty; but we know his vanity; though
it was only ridiculous, the aristocracy, whom it offended,
thought it criminal. They could not tolerate the legitimate
pride with which he constantly recalled that he was only a
<i><span lang="it">parvenu</span></i>. They thought it strange that, when attacked by
insolence, he dared to reply by raillery; and quite recently
they had shown themselves scandalized that he had forgotten
himself so far as to buy the villa of Catulus at Tusculum,
and to go and live on the Palatine in the house of Crassus.
Cicero, with his usual shrewdness, very clearly discerned all
these sentiments of the aristocracy, and even exaggerated
them. Since his return from exile he had yet other grievances
against them. They had taken much trouble to get
him recalled; but had not foreseen the splendour of his
return, and it did not seem that they were very well pleased
with it. “Those who have clipped my wings,” said Cicero,
“are sorry to see them grow again.”<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c013'><sup>[243]</sup></a> From this moment
his good friends in the senate would do nothing more for
him. He had found his finances much embarrassed, his
house on the Palatine burnt, his villas at Tusculum and
Formiae plundered and destroyed, and they decided with
reluctance to indemnify him for these losses. What irritated
him still more, was that he saw clearly that they did not
share in his anger against Clodius. They showed themselves
cool or remained silent during his violent fits of anger.
A few even, the most adroit, affected to speak only with
esteem of this factious tribune, and did not blush to give
him their hand in public. Whence came their regard for
a man who had so little for them? It was that they
hoped to make use of him, and that they secretly nourished
the thought of calling in the mob to the help of the endangered
aristocracy. This alliance, although less usual
than that of the mob with despotism, was not impossible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and the bands of Clodius, if they could be enlisted, would
have permitted the senate to hold the triumvirs in check.
Cicero, who perceived this policy, feared to become its
victim; he bitterly regretted then the services he had tried
to render to the senate, and which had cost him so dear.
In recalling the dangers to which he had exposed himself in
order to defend it, the obstinate and unsuccessful struggles
that he had maintained for four years, the ruin of his political
position and the disasters of his private fortune, he said
with sorrow: “I see clearly now that I have been only a
fool (<i><span lang="la">scio me asinum germanum fuisse</span></i>”).<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c013'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>It only remained for him then to turn to the triumvirs.
This was the advice given to him by his friend the prudent
Atticus, and his brother Quintus, whom the burning of his
house had rendered cautious contrary to his habit; this
was the resolution he was himself tempted to take every
time he ran some fresh danger. Nevertheless, he had some
trouble in making up his mind. The triumvirs had been
heretofore his most cruel enemies. Without speaking of
Crassus, in whom he detected an accomplice of Catiline, he
well knew that it was Caesar who had let Clodius loose
against him, and he could not forget that Pompey, who had
sworn to defend him, had lately abandoned him to the
vengeance of his two friends; but he had no choice of
alliances, and since he dared no longer trust the aristocratic
party, he was forced to put himself under the protection of
others. He had then to resign himself to his fate. He
authorized his brother to pledge him to Caesar and Pompey,
and prepared himself to serve their ambition. His first act,
after his return, had been to demand for Pompey one of
those extraordinary powers of which he was so greedy: by
his exertions Pompey had been entrusted for six years with
the victualling of Rome, and on this occasion he had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>invested with an almost unlimited authority. A short time
after, although the public treasury was exhausted, he had
a sum of money granted to Caesar for the payment of his
legions, and permission to have ten lieutenants under his
orders. When the aristocracy, who understood with what
design Caesar was carrying out the conquest of Gaul, wished
to prevent him continuing it, it was again Cicero who
demanded and obtained for him permission to finish his
work. It was thus that the old enemy of the triumvirs
became their usual defender before the senate. The support
that he consented to give was not useless to them.
His great name and his eloquence drew towards him the
moderate men of all parties, those whose opinion was
wavering and their convictions undecided; those, above all,
who, wearied with a too tempestuous liberty, sought everywhere
a firm hand that might give them repose; and these,
joined to the personal friends of Caesar and Pompey, to
the tools that the rich Crassus had made by bribery, and
to the ambitious men of all sorts who foresaw the advent of
the monarchy and wished to be the first to salute it, formed
in the senate a majority of which Cicero was the head
and the orator, and which rendered to the triumvirs the
important service of giving a legal sanction to that power
which they had gained by violence and exercised illegally.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero had at length obtained repose. His enemies
feared him, Clodius dared no longer risk attacking him,
his familiarity with the new masters was envied, and yet
this skilful conduct, which gained for him the thanks of the
triumvirs and the congratulations of Atticus, did not fail at
times to disturb him. It was in vain for him to say to himself
that “his life had regained its splendour,” he did not
feel less remorse in serving men whose ambition he knew,
and whom he knew to be dangerous to the liberty of his
country. In the midst of the efforts that he made to satisfy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>them, he had sudden awakenings of patriotism which made
him blush. His private correspondence bears everywhere
the trace of the alternations of mood through which he passed.
One day he wrote to Atticus in a light and resolute tone:
“Let us give up honour, justice, and fine sentiments....
Since those who can do nothing will not love me, let us try
to make ourselves loved by those who can do everything.”<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c013'><sup>[245]</sup></a>
But shame seized him the next day, and he could not
avoid saying to his friend: “Is anything sadder than our
life, mine above all? If I speak according to my convictions
I pass for a madman; if I listen to my interests, I am
accused of being a slave; if I am silent, they say I am
afraid.”<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c013'><sup>[246]</sup></a> Even in his public speeches, notwithstanding the
restraint he puts on himself, we can feel his secret dissatisfaction.
It seems to me that we discover it above all in that
extraordinary tone of bitterness and violence which was then
habitual to him. Never, perhaps, did he pronounce more
passionate invectives. Now this excess of violence towards
others often comes from a mind ill at ease. What made
his eloquence so bitter at this time was that uneasy feeling
which a man has who is in the wrong path and has not the
courage to leave it. He did not forgive his old friends their
raillery and his new ones their demands; he reproached
himself secretly for his base concessions; he had a spite
against others and against himself, and Vatinius or Piso
suffered for all the rest. In this condition of mind he could
not be a safe friend for anybody. It happened sometimes
that he suddenly turned on his new friends, and gave blows
so much the more disagreeable that they were not expected.
Sometimes he diverted himself by attacking their best friends,
to show others and prove to himself that he had not entirely
lost his liberty. People had been very much surprised to
hear him, in a speech in which he defended Caesar’s interests,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>praise to excess Bibulus, whom Caesar detested. One day
even he seemed quite ready to return to those whom he had
called honest men before he abandoned them. It seemed
to him a good opportunity to break with his new party in a
formal manner. The friendship of the triumvirs had become
very cool. Pompey was not pleased with the success of
that Gallic war which threatened to make his own victories
forgotten. Cicero, who heard him speak without restraint
against his rival, thought he might without danger give some
satisfaction to his irritated conscience, and wished by a
brilliant stroke to deserve the pardon of his old friends.
Taking advantage of some difficulty that was raised in
regard to the carrying out of Caesar’s agrarian law, he formally
announced that on the Ides of May he would speak on
the sale of the Campanian lands which by this law were
distributed among the people. The effect of his declaration
was very great. The allies of the triumvirs were as much
offended as they were surprised, and the aristocratic party
hastened to welcome with transports of joy the return of the
eloquent deserter, but in a few days everything turned against
him. At the very moment when he decided on this brilliant
stroke, the alliance between the triumvirs that was thought
to be broken, was renewed at Lucca, and, amid a concourse
of their flatterers, they once more divided the world between
them. Cicero, then, was about to find himself again alone
and without support in the presence of an angry and all-powerful
enemy who threatened to deliver him up again to
the vengeance of Clodius. Atticus scolded; Quintus, who
had pledged himself for his brother, complained roughly
that his promises were being broken. Pompey, although
he had secretly encouraged the defection, affected to be
more angry than anybody. The unhappy Cicero, attacked
on all sides, and trembling at the passions which he had
raised, hastened to submit, and promised everything that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>was required. Thus this attempt at independence only made
his slavery heavier.</p>

<p class='c014'>From this moment he seems to have resolutely accepted
his new position, from a feeling that he could not change it.
He resigned himself to heap more and more exaggerated
praises on the vain Pompey, who never had enough. He
consented to become the agent of Caesar with Oppius and
Balbus, and to supervise the public buildings he was constructing.
He went further, and was willing at the request
of his powerful protectors to give his hand to men whom
he regarded as his greatest enemies. This was not a small
sacrifice for a man who had such strong aversions; but
from the time that he joined their party so decidedly, he
was obliged to accept their friendship as he defended their
plans. They began to take steps to reconcile him to
Crassus. This was a great matter which was not done in
a day, for when it was thought that their old enmity was
appeased, it broke out all at once in a discussion in the
senate, and Cicero abused his new ally with a violence
that surprised himself. “I thought my hatred exhausted,”
said he naïvely, “and did not imagine any remained in my
heart.”<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c013'><sup>[247]</sup></a> He was then asked to undertake the defence of
Vatinius; he consented with a pretty good grace, although
he had pronounced a furious invective against him the year
before. The advocates in Rome were accustomed to these
sudden changes, and Cicero had done the same thing more
than once. When Gabinius returned from Egypt, after
having restored King Ptolemy against the formal command
of the senate, Cicero, who could not abide him, thinking it
a good opportunity to ruin him, prepared to attack him;
but Pompey came to beg him urgently to defend him. He
dared not refuse, changed his part, and submitted to speak
in favour of a man whom he detested and a cause which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>considered bad. He had at least the consolation of losing
his case, and although he was always anxious for success,
it is probable that this failure did not give him much
pain.</p>

<p class='c014'>But he well understood that so much deference and submission,
all these notorious self-contradictions to which he
was forced, would end by rousing public opinion against
him. Therefore, about this time, he decided to write an
important letter to his friend Lentulus, one of the chiefs of
the aristocracy, which he probably intended to be circulated,
and in which he explains his conduct.<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c013'><sup>[248]</sup></a> In this letter, after
having related the facts in his own way and sufficiently
abused those whom he had abandoned, a convenient and
common mode of anticipating their complaints and making
them responsible for the mischief he was about to do them,
he ventures to present, with singular candour, a sort of
apology for his political instability. The reasons he gives
to justify it are not always very good; but we must believe
that better cannot be found, since they have not ceased to
be used. Under the pretence that Plato has somewhere
said, “one must not do violence to one’s country any more
than to one’s father,” Cicero lays it down as a principle,
that a politician ought not to persist in wishing for what his
fellow-citizens do not wish, nor lose his pains in attempting
useless opposition. Circumstances change, one must change
with them, and suit oneself to the wind that blows, so as not
to go to pieces on the rocks. Besides, is that really to
change? Cannot one in the main wish for the same thing
and serve one’s country under different banners? A man
is not fickle for defending, according to circumstances,
opinions that seem contradictory if by opposite routes he
marches to the same goal, and do we not know “that we
must often shift the sails when we wish to arrive in port”?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>These are only the general maxims which an inventive
politician can make up to hide his weaknesses, and there is
no need to discuss them. The best way to defend Cicero
is to remember in what a time he lived, and how little fitted
he was for that time. This elegant literary man, this
skilful artist, this friend of the arts of peace, had been
placed, by a caprice of fate, in one of the most stormy and
troubled periods of history. What could a man of leisure
and study do among those deadly struggles where force was
master, a man who had no arms but his words, and who
always dreamed of the pleasures of peaceful times and the
pacific laurels of eloquence? A more manly soul than his
would have been needed to make head against these assaults.
Events stronger than himself confounded his designs
every instant and played with his hesitating will. On his
entry into public life he had taken for his motto, leisure and
honour, <em>otium cum dignitate</em>; but these two things are not
easy to unite in revolutionary times, and almost always one
of the two is lost when we are too anxious to preserve the
other. Resolute characters, who know this well, make their
choice between them at once, and, according as one is a
Cato or an Atticus, one decides from the very first day
either for leisure or for honour. The undecided, like
Cicero, pass from one to the other, according to circumstances,
and thus jeopardize both. We have arrived at one
of those painful moments in his life when he sacrifices
honour to leisure; let us not be too severe upon him, and
let us remember that, later, he sacrificed not only his leisure,
but even his life, to save his honour.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>II.</h4>

<p class='c015'>One of the results of the new policy of Cicero was to
give him an opportunity of becoming well acquainted with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Caesar. Not that they had been hitherto strangers to one
another. The taste of both for letters and the similar
nature of their studies, had united them in their youth, and
from these early relations, which men never forget, there had
remained some natural sympathy and good-will. But as in
later life they had attached themselves to opposite parties,
circumstances had separated them. In the Forum, and in
the senate, they had acquired the habit of always being of
opposite opinions, and naturally their friendship had suffered
from the vivacity of their dissensions. Yet Cicero tells us
that, even when they were most excited against each other,
Caesar could never hate him.<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c013'><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Politics had separated them, politics reunited them.
When Cicero turned towards the party of the triumvirs their
intimate relations recommenced; but this time their position
was different, and their connection could no longer have
the same character. The old school-fellow of Cicero had
become his protector. It was no longer a mutual inclination
or common studies, it was interest and necessity that
united them, and their new ties were formed by a sort of
reciprocal agreement in which one of the two gave his
talents and a little of his honour, that the other might
guarantee him repose. These are not very favourable
circumstances, it must be admitted, to produce a sincere
friendship. However, when we read Cicero’s private correspondence,
in which he speaks unreservedly, we cannot
doubt but that he found many charms in these relations
with Caesar which seemed to him at first to be so difficult.
Probably this was because he compared them with those
which he had at the same time to keep up with Pompey.
Caesar at least was affable and polite. Although he had
the gravest affairs on his hands, he found time to think of
his friends and to joke with them. Victorious as he was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>he allowed them to write to him “familiarly and without
subserviency.”<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c013'><sup>[250]</sup></a> He answered with amiable letters, “full of
politeness, kind attentions and charm,”<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c013'><sup>[251]</sup></a> which delighted
Cicero. Pompey, on the contrary, seemed to take a pleasure
in wounding him by his lofty airs. This pompous and vain
man, whom the adoration of the Orientals had spoilt, and
who could not avoid assuming the deportment of a conqueror
merely in going from his house at Alba to Rome,
affected an imperious and haughty tone which alienated
everybody. His dissimulation was still more displeasing
than his insolence. He had a sort of dislike of communicating
his projects to others; he hid them even from his
most devoted friends, who wished to know them in order to
support them. Cicero complains more than once that he
could never discover what he wanted; it even happened
that he was completely deceived as to his real intentions
and made him angry, thinking he was doing him a service.
This obstinate dissimulation passed, no doubt, for profound
policy in the eyes of the multitude; but the more skilful
had no difficulty in discerning its motive. If he did not
express his opinion to anybody, it was because most frequently
he had no opinion, and, as it very commonly
happens, silence with him only served to cover the fact.
He went at random, without fixed principles or settled
system, and never looked beyond present circumstances.
Events always took him by surprise, and he showed clearly
that he was no more capable of directing them than of
foreseeing them. His ambition itself, which was his
dominant passion, had no precise views or decided aims.
Whatever dignities were offered to satisfy it, it was plainly
seen that he always desired something else; this was perceived
without his saying it, for he tried very awkwardly to
hide it. His ordinary stratagem was to pretend indifference,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>and he wished to be forced to accept what he most ardently
desired. We can well understand that this pretence when
too often repeated deceived nobody. Upon the whole, as
he had successively attacked and defended all parties, and
after having often appeared to desire an almost royal
authority, had not endeavoured to destroy the republic when
he had the power to do so, it is impossible for us to discover
now what plan he had conceived, or even if he had conceived
any distinct plan at all.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not so with Caesar. He knew the object of his
ambition, and saw distinctly what he wished to do. His
plans were settled even before he entered public life;<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c013'><sup>[252]</sup></a> in
his youth he had formed the design to become master.
The spectacle of the revolutions on which he had looked
had given rise to the thought; the confidence that he had
in his own capacity, and in the inferiority of his enemies,
gave him strength to undertake it, and a sort of superstitious
belief in his destiny, not uncommon in men who attempt
these great adventures, assured him in advance of success.
Therefore he marched resolutely towards his end, without
showing undue haste to attain it, but without ever losing
sight of it. To know exactly what one wants is not a
common quality, above all in those troubled times in which
good and evil are mingled, and yet success only comes to
those who possess it. What, above all, gave Caesar his
superiority was, that in the midst of those irresolute
politicians who had only uncertain projects, hesitating convictions,
and occasional ambitions, he alone had a deliberate
ambition and a settled design. One could not approach
him without coming under the influence of that tranquil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>and powerful will, which had a clear idea of its projects,
the consciousness of its own strength, and the confidence of
victory. Cicero felt it like the rest, notwithstanding his
prejudices. In presence of such consistency and firmness
he could not avoid making unfavourable comparisons with
the perturbation and inconsistency of his old friend. “I
am of your opinion about Pompey, he hinted to his brother,
or rather you are of mine, for I have sung the praises of
Caesar for a long time.”<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c013'><sup>[253]</sup></a> In fact, it was sufficient to
approach a man of real genius to recognize the emptiness
of this semblance of a great man, whose easy successes
and air of inflated majesty had imposed so long upon the
admiration of fools.</p>

<p class='c014'>We must not, however, suppose that Caesar was one of
those stubborn men who will not give way to circumstances,
and never consent to alter anything in the plans they have
once conceived. No one, on the contrary, knew how to
bend to necessity better than he. His aim remained the
same, but he did not hesitate to take the most diverse
means to attain it, when it was necessary. One of these
important modifications took place in his policy, precisely at
the period with which we are occupied. What distinguishes
Caesar from the men with whom he is usually compared,
Alexander and Napoleon, has been well stated by M.
Mommsen, namely, that originally he was a statesman
rather than a general. He did not, like them, come from
the camp, and he had as yet merely passed through it
when, by force of circumstances and almost in spite of himself,
he became a conqueror. All his youth was passed in
Rome in the turmoil of public life, and he only set out for
Gaul at an age at which Alexander was dead and Napoleon
vanquished. He had evidently formed the plan of making
himself master without employing arms; he reckoned upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>destroying the republic by a slow and internal revolution,
and by preserving as much as possible, in so illegal an
attempt, the outward form of legality. He saw that the
popular party had more taste for social reforms than for
political liberties, and he thought, with reason, that a
democratic monarchy would not be repugnant to it. By
multiplying dissensions, by becoming the secret accomplice
of Catiline and Clodius, he wearied timid republicans of a
too troubled liberty and prepared them to sacrifice it
willingly to repose. He hoped in this way that the republic,
shaken by these daily attacks, which exhausted and tired
out its most intrepid defenders, would at last fall without
violence and without noise. But, to our great surprise, at
the moment when this skilfully-planned design seemed on
the point of succeeding, we see Caesar suddenly give it up.
After that consulship in which he had governed alone,
reducing his colleague to inaction and the senate to silence,
he withdraws from Rome for ten years, and goes to attempt
the conquest of an unknown country. What reasons
decided him to this unexpected change? We should like
to believe that he felt some disgust for that life of base
intrigues that he led at Rome, and wished to invigorate
himself in labours more worthy of him; but it is much
more likely that, after having seen clearly that the republic
would fall of itself, he understood that he would require an
army and military renown to gain the mastery over Pompey.
It was, then, without enthusiasm, without passion, designedly
and on calculation, that he decided to set out for Gaul.
When he took this important resolution, which has contributed
so much to his greatness, he was forty-four.<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c013'><sup>[254]</sup></a> Pascal
thinks it was very late to begin, and that he was too old to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>interest himself in the conquest of the world. It is, on the
contrary, as it seems, one of the most admirable efforts of
that energetic will that, at an age when habits are irrevocably
fixed, and when a man has definitely entered on the
road he must follow to the end, Caesar suddenly commenced
a new life, and, leaving in a moment the business of
popular agitator that he had followed for twenty-five years,
set himself to govern provinces and lead armies. This
spectacle, indeed, is more surprising now than it was then.
It is no longer the custom to turn oneself into an administrator
or a general at fifty, and these things seem to us to
demand a special vocation and a long apprenticeship;
history shows us that it was otherwise at Rome. Had they
not just seen the voluptuous Lucullus, on his way to command
the army of Asia, learn the art of war during the
voyage, and conquer Mithridates on his arrival? As to
administration, a rich Roman learnt it in his own home.
Those vast domains, those legions of slaves that he possessed,
the management of an immense fortune which often surpassed
the wealth of several kingdoms of our days, familiarized
him early with the art of government. It was thus
that Caesar, who had as yet only had occasion to practise
himself in the government of provinces and the command
of armies during the year of his praetorship in Spain, had no
need of further study to be able to conquer the Helvetii
and to organize the conquered countries, and that he found
himself at the very first attempt an admirable general and
an administrator of genius.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was at this epoch that his intimate relations with Cicero
recommenced, and they lasted as long as the Gallic war.
Cicero often had occasion to write to him to recommend
people who wished to serve under his command. The
ambition of the young men at that time was to set out for
Caesar’s camp. Besides the desire of taking part in great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>deeds under such a general, they had also the secret hope
of enriching themselves in those distant countries. We
know with what charms the unknown is usually adorned,
and how easy it is to lend it all the attractions we wish.
Gaul was for the imagination of that time what America
was to the sixteenth century. It was supposed that in those
countries that no one had visited there lay immense
treasures, and all who had their fortune to make hastened
to Caesar to have their share of the booty. This eagerness
was not displeasing to him; it bore witness to the fascination
his conquests exercised, and helped his designs, and accordingly
he readily invited men to come to him. He wrote
gaily to Cicero, who had begged a commission for some
unknown Roman: “You have recommended M. Offius to
me; if you like I will make him King of Gaul, unless he
prefers to be lieutenant of Lepta. Send me whom you will
that I may make him rich.”<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c013'><sup>[255]</sup></a> Cicero had with him at that
moment two persons whom he loved very much and who
had great need of being enriched, the lawyer Trebatius
Testa and his own brother Quintus. It was a good opportunity,
and he sent them both to Caesar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Trebatius was a young man of much talent and great
zeal for study, who had attached himself to Cicero and did
not leave him. He had early left his poor little town of
Ulubrae, situated in the midst of the Pontine marshes, for
Rome,—Ulubrae the deserted, <i><span lang="la">vacuae Ulubrae</span></i>, whose inhabitants
were called Ulubran frogs. He had studied law,
and, as he had become very learned in it, no doubt he
rendered many services to Cicero, who does not appear
ever to have known much of law, and who found it more
convenient to laugh at it than to learn it. Unfortunately,
consultations being gratuitous, lawyers did not make their
fortune at Rome. Accordingly Trebatius was poor, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>spite of his knowledge. Cicero, who liked him unselfishly,
consented to deprive himself of the pleasure and use that
he found in his society, and sent him to Caesar with one
of those charming letters of recommendation that he knew
so well how to write, and in which he displayed so much
grace and wit. “I do not ask of you,” he says, “the command
of a legion, or a government for him. I ask for
nothing definite. Give him your friendship, and if afterwards
you care to do something for his fortune and his
glory I shall not be displeased. In fact, I abandon him
to you entirely; I give him to you from hand to hand as
they say, and I hope he will find himself well off in those
faithful and victorious hands.”<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c013'><sup>[256]</sup></a> Caesar thanked Cicero
for the present that he had made him, which could not fail
to be very valuable to him, “for,” he wittily remarked,
“among the multitude of men who surround me, there is
not one who knows how to prepare a suit.”<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c013'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Trebatius left Rome reluctantly; Cicero said that he had
to turn him out of doors.<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c013'><sup>[258]</sup></a> The first sight of Gaul, which
resembled very little the France of to-day, was not cheering.
He passed wild countries, among half-subdued and threatening
people, and in the midst of these barbarian surroundings
which oppressed his heart, he always thought of the pleasures
of that cultivated city that he had just left. The
letters that he wrote were so disconsolate, that Cicero,
forgetting that he had felt the same regrets during his own
exile, reproached him gently for what he called his foolishness.
When he arrived at the camp his ill-humour was
redoubled. Trebatius was not a warrior, and it is very
likely that the Nervii and the Atrebates frightened him very
much. He arrived just at the moment when Caesar was
setting out on the expedition to Britain, and refused, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>knows not on what pretext, to accompany him: perhaps
he alleged, like Dumnorix, that he feared the sea; but,
even in remaining in Gaul there was no want of danger
and tedium. Their winter quarters were not comfortable;
they suffered from cold and rain under that inclement sky.
In summer they had to take the field, and his terror recommenced.
Trebatius was always complaining. What added
to his discontent was that he had not found all at once the
advantages he had expected. He had set out unwillingly,
and wished to return as quickly as possible. Cicero said
that he had looked on the letter of recommendation that
he had given him to Caesar as a bill of exchange payable
to bearer.<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c013'><sup>[259]</sup></a> He thought he had only to present himself in
order to take the money, and return. It was not only
money he went to look for in Gaul; he expected to find
there a post of distinction and importance. He wished to
approach Caesar and make himself appreciated. Cicero
writes to him: “You would much rather be consulted than
covered with gold.”<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c013'><sup>[260]</sup></a> Now, Caesar was so busy that he
was difficult to approach, and he did not at first pay any
great attention to this learned lawyer who came to him
from Rome. He contented himself with offering him the
title and emoluments of a military tribune, without the
duties, of course. Trebatius did not think this a sufficient
reward for the length of his journey and the dangers of the
country, and thought of returning. Cicero had much
trouble to prevent this rash conduct. I do not think there
is any part of his correspondence more amusing and more
lively than the letters he wrote to Trebatius to induce him
to remain. Cicero is at his ease with this obscure young
man, for whom he had such a lively affection. He dares
to laugh freely, which he does not do with everybody, and
he laughs all the more readily as he knows Trebatius was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>low-spirited, and he wishes to console him. It seems to
me that this trouble that he takes to cheer up an unhappy
friend makes his pleasantries almost touching, and that his
good heart here lends one more charm to his wit. He
quizzes him good-naturedly in order to make him laugh,
and jokes about things that he knows the good Trebatius
does not mind being bantered on. For instance, one day
he asks him to send him all the details of the campaign:
“For an account of a battle,” he says, “I trust above all
the most timorous;”<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c013'><sup>[261]</sup></a> probably because, having held themselves
aloof from the fight, they will have been better able
to see the whole. Another time, after having expressed
some fear at seeing him exposed to so many dangers, he
adds: “Happily I know your prudence; you are much
bolder in presenting writs than in harassing the enemy,
and I remember that, although you are a good swimmer,
you would not cross over into Britain for fear of taking a
bath in the ocean.”<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c013'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>To soothe his impatience he threatens him with the
wags. Was it not to be feared that if he returned, Laberius
would put him in one of his farces? A frightened lawyer
travelling in the train of an army, and exercising his profession
among the barbarians, would make a funny figure
in a comedy; but, to silence the wags he had only to make
his fortune. Let him return later, he would certainly return
richer; Balbus had said so. Now, Balbus was a banker;
he did not speak in the sense of the Stoics, who affirm that
one is always rich enough when one can enjoy the spectacle
of the sky and the earth; he spoke as a Roman and meant
that he would return well furnished with crown-pieces,
<i><span lang="la">more romano bene nummatum</span></i>. Trebatius remained, and
he did well to do so. Caesar was not long in noticing him,
and was pleased with his friendship. He got accustomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>to camp life, and in time became a little less timid than
he was on his arrival. It is probable that he returned rich,
as Balbus had predicted, for if they did not find all the
treasures they went to seek in Gaul, Caesar’s liberality was
an inexhaustible mine that enriched all his friends. At a
later period Trebatius passed through trying times, and yet
preserved the reputation of an honest man; this was an
act of justice that all parties did him, although they were
not much in the habit of doing justice. He had the rare
good fortune to escape all the perils of the civil wars, and
was still living in the time of Horace, who addressed one
of his most agreeable satires to him. We see in it that he
was then an amiable and indulgent old man who readily
laughed and amused himself with the young. He talked to
them, no doubt, about that grand epoch of which he was one
of the last survivors, of the Gallic war in which he had taken
part, of Caesar and his captains whom he had known. By
the privilege of his age he could speak of Lucretius to
Virgil, of Cicero to Livy, of Catullus to Propertius, and
formed a sort of link between the two most illustrious
periods of Latin literature.</p>

<p class='c014'>The other person whom Cicero sent to Caesar was his
brother Quintus. As he holds a large place in Cicero’s
life, and played a rather important part in the Gallic war,
it will be proper, I think, to say a few words about him.
Although he listened to the same lectures and learned from
the same masters as his brother, he never had any taste
for eloquence, and always refused to speak in public.
“One orator,” he said, “is enough in a family, and even
in a city.”<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c013'><sup>[263]</sup></a> He was of a hard and yet changeable disposition,
and gave way to violent fits of anger without
reason. In spite of an appearance of great energy he was
soon discouraged, and although he always affected to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>the master, he was led by those about him. These faults,
that Cicero bewailed to himself although he tried to excuse
them, prevented Quintus succeeding in his public career,
and troubled his private life.</p>

<p class='c014'>He had been early married to Pomponia, the sister of
Atticus. This marriage that the two friends had hoped
would draw closer their connection very nearly broke it.
The couple found that their characters matched too well:
both were hasty and passionate, and they could never
agree, and the unbounded ascendency that Statius, a slave,
had over his master’s mind completed the disunion of the
household. In connection with this, it would be easy to
show, from Cicero’s letters, what influence the slave often
exercised in ancient families; a much greater one than is
commonly supposed. Now that the servant is free, it would
seem natural that he should take a more important place
in our houses than before. But the contrary has happened;
he has lost in influence what he has gained in dignity. When
he became independent his master ceased to have any
obligations towards him. They now live together bound by
a temporary contract, which, by imposing reciprocal obligations,
appears irksome to both sides. As this fragile bond
may be broken at any moment, and as these allies of one
day may become indifferent to each other or enemies on the
next, there is no longer any ease or confidence between them,
and they pass all the time during which chance brings them
together in surrounding themselves with defences, and in
watching one another. It was quite otherwise in antiquity
when slavery was flourishing. Then, it was not for a short
time only, it was for a whole life-time that they were
united; accordingly, they set themselves to know each other,
and to adapt themselves one to the other. To gain the
master’s favour was the important thing for the future of
the slave, and he took trouble to gain it. As he had no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>position to defend, or dignity to preserve, he gave himself
up to him entirely. He flattered and served his worst
passions without scruple, and at last made himself necessary
to him. Once confirmed in this intimacy, by his constant
subserviency, by private and secret services which his
master was not afraid to demand, and which he never
refused to give, he ruled the family, so that, however strange
it may appear at first sight, it is true to say that the servant
was never nearer being master than when he was a slave.
This is what happened to Statius. Through the knowledge
that he had of the defects of Quintus, he had insinuated
himself so well into his confidence that the whole family
gave way to him. Pomponia alone resisted, and the annoyance
she suffered for this reason made her still more
insupportable. She constantly worried her husband with
unfriendly remarks; she refused to appear at the dinners
that he gave on the pretext that she was only a stranger at
home, or if she consented to be present, it was only to
make the guests the witnesses of the most unpleasant scenes.
It was, no doubt, one day when she was more peevish and
cross-grained than usual that Quintus composed these two
epigrams, the only examples that remain of his poetic
talent.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Trust your ship to the winds, but do not give up your
soul to a woman. There is less safety in a woman’s words
than in the caprices of the waves.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No woman is good; or if by chance you find a good
woman, I know not by what strange fate a bad thing has
become good in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c014'>These two epigrams are not very gallant, but we must
excuse them in the unfortunate husband of the shrewish
Pomponia.</p>

<p class='c014'>The political career of Quintus was not brilliant any more
than his private life was happy. He owed the offices which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>he obtained more to the illustrious name of his brother than
to his own merit, and did nothing to make himself worthy
of them. After he had been aedile and praetor, he was
appointed governor of Asia. To be invested with an
unlimited authority was a severe test for a character like
his. Absolute power turned his head; his violence, which
nothing now restrained, knew no bounds; like an oriental
despot he only talked of burning and hanging. He wished
above all to obtain the glory of being a great lover of justice.
Having had occasion to order two parricides to be sewn up
in a sack and thrown into the water in the lower part of his
province, he wished to give the same spectacle to the other
part on his visit to it, that there might be no jealousy between
them. He sought therefore to seize a certain Zeuxis, an
important person, who had been accused of killing his
mother, and who had been acquitted by the tribunals. On
the arrival of the governor, Zeuxis, who guessed his intentions,
fled, and Quintus, vexed at losing his parricide, wrote
him most friendly letters to induce him to return. Usually,
however, he dissembled less and spoke more openly. He
sent word to one of his lieutenants to seize and burn alive
a certain Licinius and his son who had embezzled. He
wrote to a Roman knight named Catienus “that he hoped
to have him suffocated one day in the smoke, with the
applause of the province.”<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c013'><sup>[264]</sup></a> It is true that when he was
reproached with having written these furious letters, he
replied that they were simple jokes, and that he had wished
to laugh for a moment, but it was a strange way of joking,
and shows his barbarous nature. Quintus had none the
less an enlightened mind, he had read Plato and Xenophon,
he spoke Greek admirably well, he even wrote tragedies in
his leisure hours. He had all the appearance of a polished
and civilized man, but it was only the appearance. Even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>among the most well-bred Romans, civilization was often
only on the surface, and under their polished exterior we
often find the rough and savage soul of a pitiless race of
soldiers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Quintus came back from his province with a rather bad
reputation, but, what is more surprising, he did not come
back rich. Apparently he had embezzled less than his
colleagues, and was not able to bring back enough money
to restore his fortune, which was very much embarrassed by
his extravagance; for he liked to buy and to build, like his
brother; he had a taste for rare books, and probably also
could refuse nothing to his favourite slaves. The exile of
Cicero completed the confusion of his affairs, and at the
time of his brother’s return Quintus was quite ruined. This
did not prevent him, at the time of his greatest financial
distress, rebuilding his house at Rome, and buying a country
house at Arpinum and another in the suburbs, constructing
in his villa at Arcae, baths, porticoes, fish-ponds, and such a
fine road that it was taken for a work of the state. It is true
that the poverty of a Roman of that time would make the
fortune of many of our nobles. However, a day came when
Quintus was altogether in the hands of his creditors, and
when he could borrow no more. Then it was that he
bethought him of the last resource of embarrassed debtors:
he went to Caesar.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was not, then, only the love of glory that attracted
Quintus to Gaul; he went there, like so many others, to
get rich. Up to that time, the results had not answered
to men’s expectations, and they had not found among
people like the Belgae and Germani all the treasures that
they looked for; but they were not yet discouraged; rather
than give up their brilliant fancies, after each disappointment,
they put farther off that enchanted country where
they thought they must find riches. As at this moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>they were going to attack Britain, it was in Britain that they
placed it. Every one expected to make a fortune there, and
Caesar himself, by what Suetonius says, hoped to bring back
many pearls.<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c013'><sup>[265]</sup></a> These expectations were deceived once more;
in Britain were neither pearls nor gold mines. They had a
great deal of trouble to take a few slaves who were not of
much value, for it was no use thinking of making them men
of letters and musicians. For all wealth, these men only
possessed heavy chariots, from which they fought with
courage. Accordingly Cicero wrote humorously to
Trebatius, who sent him news of this ill-luck of the
army: “Since you find there neither gold nor silver, my
opinion is that you should carry off one of those British
chariots, and should come to us at Rome without stopping.”<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c013'><sup>[266]</sup></a>
Quintus was very much of the same opinion.
Although he had been well received by Caesar, who had
appointed him his lieutenant, when he saw that wealth did
not come as quickly as he expected, he lost courage, and,
like Trebatius, he had for a moment the idea of returning;
but Cicero, who did not joke this time, prevented him.</p>

<p class='c014'>He did him a very great service, for it was precisely
during the winter that followed the war in Britain that
Quintus had the opportunity of performing the heroic
action that commended his name to the respect of military
men. Although he read Sophocles with ardour and had
written tragedies, he was at bottom only a soldier. In the
presence of the enemy, he became himself again, and displayed
an energy that had not been suspected in him. In the
midst of populations which were in revolt, in entrenchments
hastily raised in one night, and with a single legion only, he
was able to defend the camp Caesar had entrusted to him,
and to make head against innumerable enemies, who had
just destroyed a Roman army. He replied in firm language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>to their insolent boasts. Although he was ill, he displayed
incredible activity, and it was only after a sedition among his
soldiers that he could be induced to take care of himself.
I have no need to relate the details of this affair that Caesar
has told so well in his <em>Commentaries</em>, and which is one of
the most glorious incidents of the Gallic war. This grand
feat of arms raises Quintus in our esteem; it effaces the
meannesses of his character, and helps him to play with
a little more credit the ungrateful and difficult part of
younger brother of a great man.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>III.</h4>

<p class='c015'>Cicero had clearly foreseen that, although Caesar in
writing his <em>Commentaries</em> professed only to prepare materials
for history, the perfection of his work would prevent sensible
men from attempting to re-write it. Accordingly Plutarch
and Dio have taken care not to re-write it; they are contented
to epitomize it, and now we only know the Gallic
war by the narrative of him who was the hero of it. However
perfect the narrative may be, or rather because of its
very perfection, we have much difficulty in contenting ourselves
with it. It is the characteristic of these great works,
which, as we might think, ought to exhaust public curiosity,
on the contrary, to make it more active. By interesting us
in the facts which they relate, they excite in us the desire
to know them better, and one of the surest marks of their
success is that they do not suffice for the readers, and make
them wish to know more than they tell. This desire, for
fresh details on the most important events of history, it is
which renders Cicero’s letters to Trebatius and to his
brother so valuable for us. Although they are fewer in
number and shorter than we could wish, they have the
merit of adding some information to that which Caesar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>gives on his campaigns. As they are more familiar than a
narrative composed for the public, they introduce us farther
into the private life of the conqueror of Gaul, and they
permit us to see him in his tent, at those times of leisure
and repose, of which he has not thought of speaking to us
himself. This is certainly an interesting spectacle, it is the
true complement of the <em>Commentaries</em>, and we cannot do
better than carefully collect the scattered details they contain,
in order to become well acquainted with Caesar and
his surroundings.</p>

<p class='c014'>I imagine that Caesar’s army did not resemble those old
Roman armies that are depicted to us in such grave and
temperate guise, always trembling under the rod of the
lictors, and submissive at all times to an inflexible discipline.
It was, doubtless, sternly controlled in time of
danger, and never complained of this. No other army has
ever undergone greater fatigues and executed greater deeds;
but when the danger was over discipline relaxed. Caesar
allowed his soldiers rest, and sometimes diversion. He let
them decorate themselves with splendid arms, and even
adorn themselves with studied elegance. “What does it
matter if they use perfumes?” he said, “they will know very
well how to fight.”<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c013'><sup>[267]</sup></a> And in fact these soldiers, whom
the Pompeians called effeminate, are the same who, though
dying of hunger at Dyrrhachium, declared that they would
eat the bark of the trees rather than let Pompey escape.
They were recruited for the most part among those Cisalpine
Gauls from whom Roman civilization had not taken the
good qualities of their race, an amiable and brilliant people
who loved war and carried it on gaily. The chiefs very
much resembled the common soldiers; they were lively
and ardent, full of resources in critical moments, and trusted
more to inspiration than to routine. It is to be remarked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>that no one of them had gained his reputation in earlier
wars. Caesar seems to have wished that their military glory
should come from him only. A few, and among these
Labienus, perhaps the greatest of them, were his political
friends, old conspirators like himself, who, after his example,
and without any more preparation, from popular agitators
had become excellent generals. Others, on the contrary, like
Fabius Maximus and Servius Galba, bore illustrious names;
they were partisans whom he secured in the aristocracy, or
hostages that he took from it. The greater number, Crassus,
Plancus, Volcatius Tullus, Decimus Brutus, and later
Pollio, were young men whom he treated with marked
preference, and whom he readily trusted in perilous enterprises.
He liked the young by personal preference, and
also by policy: as they did not yet belong to any party,
and had not had time to attach themselves to the republic
by serving it, he hoped they would have less difficulty in
accustoming themselves to the new <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i> that he wished
to establish.</p>

<p class='c014'>These lieutenants, whose number varied, did not alone
form the ordinary retinue of a proconsul. We must remember
to add that crowd of young Romans, sons of
illustrious houses, destined by their birth for public office,
who came to serve their apprenticeship in war under him.
They were called his tent-comrades, <i><span lang="la">contubernales</span></i>. Soldiers
like the rest, and exposing themselves on the day of battle,
they became after the fight the friends, the companions of
the chief whom they followed in all his expeditions, as the
clients accompanied their patron in the city. They were
present at his receptions, took part in all his recreations
and diversions, sat at his table, surrounded him when he sat
on the judgment-seat; they formed, in sum, what was called
the cohort, we should almost say the court, of the praetor
(<i><span lang="la">praetoria cohors</span></i>). Scipio Africanus, it is said, invented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>this means of adding splendour to the public display of
the supreme power in the eyes of the conquered nations,
and after him governors had taken great care to preserve
all this pomp which added to their prestige. These were
not all; by the side of these military men there was room
for men of very various abilities and positions. Able
financiers, intelligent secretaries, and even learned lawyers
might be necessary for the administration of those vast
countries that a proconsul governed. Thus Trebatius himself,
the pacific Trebatius, was not out of place in the train
of an army, and he had opportunities of exercising his profession
even among the Nervii and the Belgae. If we add
to these men, to whom their high offices gave a certain
importance, a crowd of inferior officers or subaltern servants,
such as lictors, ushers, scribes, interpreters, apparitors,
doctors, men-servants, and even soothsayers, we shall have
some idea of that truly royal retinue which a proconsul
always carried about with him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Caesar’s train must have been even more magnificent
than that of others. The ten legions that he commanded,
the extent of country that he had to conquer and govern,
explain the great number of officers and persons of all sorts
by whom he was surrounded. Moreover, he naturally loved
magnificence. He readily welcomed all who came to see
him, and always found some office to give them in order to
retain them. Even in those wild countries he took pleasure
in astonishing them by his reception. Suetonius relates
that he took with him everywhere marquetry or mosaic
floors, and that he had always two tables laid at which rich
Romans who visited him and provincials of distinction took
their places.<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c013'><sup>[268]</sup></a> His lieutenants imitated him, and Pinarius
wrote to Cicero that he was delighted with the dinners his
brother gave him.<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c013'><sup>[269]</sup></a> Caesar did not care much for these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>sumptuous repasts, and these rich dwellings, on his own
account. We know that he was temperate, that in case of
need he could sleep well in the open air, and eat rancid oil
without blinking; but he had a taste for display and luxury.
Although the republic still existed, he was almost a king;
even in his camps in Britain and Germany he had assiduous
followers and courtiers. He could only be approached with
difficulty; Trebatius made the attempt, and we know that
it was a long time before he could reach him. No doubt
Caesar did not receive men with that stiff and solemn
majesty that repelled them in Pompey; but, however
gracious he might wish to be, there was always something
in him that inspired respect, and it was felt that that ease
of manner that he affected with everybody proceeded from
a superiority which was sure of itself. This defender of the
democracy was none the less an aristocrat who never forgot
his birth, and willingly spoke of his ancestors. Had they
not heard him, at the commencement of his political life,
at the very time when he attacked with most vivacity the
institutions of Sulla, and tried to get back their ancient
powers for the tribunes, had they not heard him pronounce
over his aunt a funeral oration full of genealogical fictions,
in which he complacently related that his family was descended
at once from the kings and the gods? But in
this he only followed the traditions of the Gracchi, his
illustrious predecessors. They also defended public interests
with ardour, but they called to mind the aristocracy from
which they had sprung by the haughty elegance of their
manners. We know that they had a court of clients at
their rising, and that they were the first who thought
of making distinctions between them which resembled
the public and private admissions to the court of
Louis XIV.</p>

<p class='c014'>The most remarkable thing in those around Caesar was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>their love of letters. Assuredly they belonged no longer to
the times when Roman generals burnt masterpieces of art,
or took a pride in being ignorant. Since Mummius and
Marius, letters had succeeded in penetrating even the
camps, which, as we know, are not their usual abode.
Nevertheless, I do not think that so many enlightened men
of letters, so many men of culture and men of fashion have
ever been seen united in any other army. Almost all
Caesar’s lieutenants were private friends of Cicero, and
they took pleasure in maintaining a constant intercourse
with him who was regarded as the official patron of literature
at Rome. Crassus and Plancus had learnt eloquence in
pleading at his side, and in what remains to us of the letters
of Plancus, we recognize, by a certain oratorical exuberance,
that he had profited by his lessons. Trebonius, the conqueror
of Marseilles, professed to relish his witticisms very
much, and even published a collection of them. Cicero,
however, to whom this admiration was not displeasing,
thought that his editor had put too much of himself into
the introduction under pretence of preparing the effect of
the jokes and making them easier to understand. “They
have exhausted their laughter,” he said, “when they get to
me.” Hirtius was a distinguished historian, who undertook
later to finish the <em>Commentaries</em> of his chief. Matius, a
devoted friend of Caesar, who showed himself worthy of
this friendship by remaining faithful to him, translated the
<em>Iliad</em> into Latin verse. Quintus was a poet also, but a
tragic poet. During the winter that he had to fight the
Nervii, he was seized with such an ardour for poetry, that
he composed four pieces in sixteen days: but this was to
treat tragedy in a somewhat military fashion. He sent the
one he thought the best, the <em>Erigone</em>, to his brother; but
it was lost on the road. “Since Caesar has commanded
in Gaul,” said Cicero, “the <em>Erigone</em> alone has not been able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>to travel in safety.”<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c013'><sup>[270]</sup></a> It is surprising no doubt to meet all
at one time with so many generals who are also men of
letters; but what is still more astonishing is that all those
Roman knights who followed the army, and whom Caesar
made his commissaries and purveyors, collectors of stores,
and farmers of the taxes, seem to have loved literature more
than their habits and occupations usually admit. We find
one of those he employed in offices of this kind, Lepta,
thanking Cicero for sending him a treatise on rhetoric as
though he were a man capable of appreciating the present.
The Spaniard Balbus, that intelligent banker, that skilful
administrator, who was able to put the finances of Rome
into such good order, and what was still more difficult,
those of Caesar, loved philosophy with more enthusiasm
than one would expect in a banker. He hastened to have
Cicero’s works copied before they were known to the public,
and although he was by character the most discreet of men,
he went so far as even to commit indiscretions in order to
be the first to read them.</p>

<p class='c014'>But among all these lettered men, it was Caesar who had
the most decided taste for letters: they suited his cultivated
nature; they seemed to him, no doubt, the most agreeable
exercise and relaxation of an accomplished mind. I should
not, however, venture to say that his love for them was
wholly disinterested, when I see that this taste assisted his
policy so wonderfully. He was compelled to gain public
favour by every means; now, nothing attracts the general
judgment more than the superiority of intelligence united
with that of force. His principal works were composed with
this intention, and we might say, from this point of view,
that his writings were part of his actions. It was not only
to please a few idle men of letters that, during the latter part
of his stay in Gaul, he wrote his <cite>Commentaries</cite> with such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>rapidity as to astonish his friends. He wished to prevent
the Romans forgetting his victories; he wished, by his
admirable manner of narrating them, to renew, and if
possible, to increase, the effect they had produced. When
he composed his two books <cite>De Analogia</cite>, he calculated that
people would be struck by seeing the general of an army,
who, according to the expression of Fronto, “busied himself
with the formation of words while arrows were cleaving
the air, and sought the laws of language amid the din of
clarions and trumpets.” He knew very well the advantage
that his reputation would draw from these very diverse
performances, and how great would be the surprise and admiration
at Rome when they received at the same moment
a treatise on grammar, and the news of a new victory, from
such a distance. The same thought also made him eager
for Cicero’s friendship. If his refined and distinguished
nature found a great pleasure in keeping up some intercourse
with a man of so much cultivation, he was not
ignorant of the power this man exercised over public
opinion, and how far his praises would resound when they
came from this eloquent mouth. We have lost the letters
that he wrote to Cicero; but as Cicero was delighted with
them, and it was not very easy to please him, we must
believe that they were filled with flatteries and caresses.
Cicero’s answers were also full of the most lively protestations
of friendship. He declared at that time that Caesar
came in his affections immediately after his children, and indeed
almost in the same rank; he bitterly deplored all the
prejudices that had up till then kept him apart from him,
and he resolved to make him forget that he was one of the
last who had entered into his friendship. “I shall imitate,”
said he, “the travellers who have risen later than they wished
to do; they double their speed, and make such good haste
that they arrive at their destination before those who have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>travelled part of the night.”<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c013'><sup>[271]</sup></a> They vied with each other,
as it were, in compliments; they overwhelmed one another
with flatteries, and emulated each other in works in verse
and prose. On reading the first accounts of the expedition
to Britain, Cicero exclaimed in a transport of enthusiasm:
“What prodigious events! what a country! what people!
what battles, and above all, what a general!” He wrote
off immediately to his brother: “Give me Britain to paint;
furnish me with the colours, I will use the brush.”<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c013'><sup>[272]</sup></a> And
he had seriously taken in hand an epic poem on this conquest,
which his occupations prevented him completing as
quickly as he wished. Caesar, on his part, dedicated his
treatise <cite><span lang="la">De Analogia</span></cite> to Cicero, and on this occasion said
to him in splendid phrases: “You have discovered all the
resources of eloquence, and are the first to use them. In
virtue of this you have deserved well of the Roman name,
and you do honour to our country. You have obtained the
most illustrious of all honours, and a triumph preferable to
those of the greatest generals, for it is better to extend the
boundaries of the mind than to enlarge the limits of the
empire!”<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c013'><sup>[273]</sup></a> This, coming from a victorious general like
Caesar, was the most delicate flattery for a man of letters.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such were the relations that Cicero kept up with Caesar
and his officers during the Gallic war. His correspondence,
which preserves the memory of them, makes us better acquainted
with the tastes and preferences of all these men of
cultivation, and shows them to us in a very living fashion
and draws us closer to them. This is, assuredly, one of
the greatest services it could render to us. We seem, when
we have read it, to be able to understand of what kind the
meetings of these men must have been, and can imagine
ourselves present at their conversations. We are entitled to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>suppose that Rome took up very much of their thoughts.
From the depths of Gaul, they had their eyes upon it, and it
was to make a little stir there that they took so much trouble.
While marching over so many unknown countries from the
Rhine to the Ocean, all these young men hoped that they
would be talked about at those feasts and assemblies where
men of the world discussed public affairs. Caesar himself,
when he crossed the Rhine on his wooden bridge, reckoned
upon striking the imaginations of all those idlers who met
together in the Forum, at the rostrum, to learn the news. After
the landing of his troops in Britain, we see him hastening
to write to his friends, and especially to Cicero;<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c013'><sup>[274]</sup></a> not that
he had much leisure at that moment, but he looked upon it
no doubt as an honour to date his letter from a country where
no Roman had yet set foot. If he was anxious to send
glorious news to Rome, they were also very glad to receive
it from Rome. All the letters that arrived were read with
eagerness; they seemed as it were to carry even to Germany
and Britain a whiff of that fashionable life, which those who
have enjoyed can never forget or cease to regret. It was
not enough for Caesar to read the <cite>journals of the Roman
people</cite>, which contained a dry summary of the principal
political events, and a concise report of the proceedings of
the assemblies of the people. His messengers constantly
traversed Gaul, bringing him letters accurate and full of the
most minute details. “He is told everything,” said Cicero,
“small as well as great.”<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c013'><sup>[275]</sup></a> This news, impatiently waited
for, and commented on with pleasure, must have been the
usual subject of his conversations with his friends. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>suppose that, at that sumptuous table of which I have
spoken, after literature and grammar had been discussed,
and they had listened to the verses of Matius or Quintus,
the conversation turned especially upon Rome, of which
these elegant young men, who regretted its pleasures, were
never tired of talking. Certainly, if we could have heard
them chatting about the last news, the political disorders,
or, what interested them more, the private scandals of the
city, telling the last rumours afloat, and quoting the most
recent jokes, we should have found it difficult to believe
that we were in the heart of the country of the Belgae, or
near to the Rhine or the Ocean, or on the eve of a battle.
I imagine that we should have rather fancied we were
present at a party of clever men in some aristocratic house
on the Palatine or in the rich quarter of Carinae.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero’s letters render us yet another service. They show
us the prodigious effect that Caesar’s victories produced at
Rome. They excited as much surprise as admiration, for
they were discoveries as well as conquests. What was
known before him of those distant countries? A few
ridiculous fables that traders related on their return, to give
themselves importance. It was through Caesar that they
were first really known. He first dared to attack, and he
vanquished those Germans who have been depicted as giants,
whose very looks caused terror; he first adventured as far
as Britain, where it was said the night lasted three entire
months, and all the wonders that had been related gave as
it were a tinge of the marvellous to his victories. Nevertheless,
not everybody willingly gave way to this fascination.
The most clear-sighted of the aristocratic party, who felt,
though indistinctly, that it was the fate of the republic that
was being decided on the banks of the Rhine, wished to
recall Caesar, and to appoint in his place another general,
who might not perhaps complete the conquest of Gaul, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>who would not be tempted to carry out that of his own
country. Cato, who pushed everything to extremes, when
the senate was asked to vote a thanksgiving to the gods for
the defeat of Ariovistus, dared to propose, on the contrary,
that they should deliver up the conqueror to the Germans.
But these objections did not change public opinion, which
declared itself in favour of him who had just conquered
with such rapidity so many unknown countries. The
knights, who had become the financiers and merchants of
Rome, congratulated themselves on seeing immense countries
opened up to their operations. Caesar, who wished to
attach them to him, invited them to follow him, and his
first care had been to open them a road across the Alps.
The common people, who love military glory and who
freely give way to enthusiasm, were never tired of admiring
him who extended the limits of the Roman world. On the
news of each victory, Rome had public rejoicings, and
offered thanksgivings to the gods. After the defeat of the
Belgae, the senate, under pressure of public opinion, was
compelled to vote fifteen days of solemn thanksgiving, which
had never been done for anybody. Twenty days was
decreed, when the success of the expedition against Germany
was reported, and twenty more after the taking of Alesia.
Cicero usually demanded these honours for Caesar, and he
became the mouthpiece of the public admiration when he
said in his noble language: “This is the first time we have
dared to attack the Gauls, hitherto we have been content
to repulse them. The other generals of the Roman people
regarded it as sufficient for their glory to prevent them
invading us; Caesar has gone to seek them out in their
own homes. Our general, our legions, our arms have overrun
those countries of which no history has ever spoken, of
whose name the world was ignorant. We had only a footpath
in Gaul; now the boundaries of these nations have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>become the frontiers of our own empire. It is not without
the signal favour of Providence that nature gave the Alps
for a rampart to Italy. If the entrance had been free to
this multitude of barbarians, Rome never would have been
the centre and the seat of the empire of the world. Now
let insurmountable mountains sink. From the Alps to the
Ocean Italy has nothing now to fear.”<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c013'><sup>[276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>These magnificent eulogies, for which Cicero has been so
much blamed, are easily understood however, and, whatever
politicians may say, it is easy to explain the enthusiasm that
so many honest and sensible people then felt for Caesar.
That which justified the unreserved admiration that his
conquests caused, was less their grandeur than their
necessity. They might threaten the future, at that moment
they were indispensable. They later endangered the liberty
of Rome, but they assured her existence then.<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c013'><sup>[277]</sup></a> The
patriotic instinct of the people let them divine what
prejudice and fear, although quite legitimate, hid from the
aristocracy. They understood in a confused way all the
dangers that might soon come from Gaul, if they did not
hasten to subdue it. It was not, in truth, the Gauls who
were to be feared—their decadence had already commenced,
and they no longer thought of making conquests—it was
the Germans. Dio is quite wrong in asserting that Caesar
wantonly stirred up wars for the sake of his glory. Whatever
advantage he drew from them, we may certainly say
that he rather submitted to them than provoked them. It
was not Rome that went to seek the Germans at that time,
but rather the Germans who came boldly towards her.
When Caesar was appointed proconsul, Ariovistus occupied
part of the country of the Sequani and wished to seize the
rest. His compatriots, attracted by the fertility of this fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>country, were crossing the Rhine every day to join him,
and twenty-five thousand had come at one time. What
would have happened to Italy if, while Rome was losing
her strength in intestine struggles, the Suevi and the
Sicambri had established themselves on the Rhone and the
Alps? The invasion averted by Marius a century before
was recommencing; it might have caused the downfall of
Rome then as it did four centuries later, if Caesar had not
arrested it. His glory is to have thrown back the Germans
beyond the Rhine, as it was to the honour of the empire
to have kept them there for more than three hundred years.</p>

<p class='c014'>But this was not the sole or even the greatest effect
of Caesar’s victories. In conquering Gaul, he rendered it
entirely and for ever Roman. That marvellous rapidity
with which Rome then assimilated the Gauls can only be
understood, when we know in what a state she had found
them. They were not altogether barbarians like the
Germans; it is to be remarked that their conqueror, who
knew them well, does not call them so in his <em>Commentaries</em>.
They had great cities, a regular system of taxation, a body
of religious beliefs, an ambitious and powerful aristocracy,
and a sort of national education directed by the priests.
This culture, although imperfect, if it had not entirely
enlightened their minds, had at least awakened them.
They were frank and inquisitive, intelligent enough to know
what they were deficient in, and sufficiently free from
prejudice to give up their usages when they found better
ones. From the very beginning of the war, they succeeded
in imitating the Roman tactics, in constructing
siege machines, and in working them with a skill to which
Caesar does justice. They were still rude and unpolished,
but already quite inclined for a superior civilization for
which they had the desire and instinct. This explains
how they did so readily accept it. They had fought for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>ten years against the domination of the foreigner; they did
not hesitate for a day to adopt his language and usages.
We may say that Gaul resembled those lands, parched by a
burning sun, which drink in with such avidity the first drops
of rain; so completely did she imbibe the Roman civilization
for which she longed before she knew it, that after so
many centuries, and in spite of so many revolutions, she
has not yet lost the mark of it; and this is the only thing
that has endured to the present time in this country where
everything changes. Caesar, then, did not only add a few
new territories to the possessions of Rome; the present
that he made her was greater and more useful; he gave her
an entire people, intelligent, and civilized almost as soon
as conquered, which, becoming Roman in heart as well as
in language, sinking her interests in those of her new
nationality, enlisting in her legions to defend her, and
throwing herself with a remarkable ardour and talent into
the study of the arts and letters, shed a new lustre over her,
and for a long time gave a new youth and a return of vigour
to the failing empire.</p>

<p class='c014'>While these great events were passing in Gaul, Rome
continued to be the theatre of the most shameful disorders.
There was no longer any government; scarcely did they
succeed in electing magistrates, and there was a fight every
time the people assembled in the Forum or in the Campus
Martius. These disorders, of which honest men were
ashamed, added still more to the effect that Caesar’s
victories produced. What a contrast was there between
the battles fought with Ariovistus or Vercingetorix and
those combats of gladiators that stained the streets of
Rome with blood! And how glorious appeared the taking
of Agendicum or Alesia to people who were only occupied
with the siege of Milo’s house by Clodius or the assassination
of Clodius by Milo! All the statesmen who had remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>in Rome, Pompey as well as Cicero, had lost something of
their dignity by mixing themselves up in these intrigues.
Caesar, who had withdrawn in time, was the only man who
had risen amidst the general degradation. Therefore all
those whose heart was wounded by these sad spectacles,
and who had some care for Roman honour, kept their eyes
fixed upon him and his army. As happened at certain
moments of our own revolution, military glory consoled
honest men for scandals and distress at home. At the
same time, the excess of the evil caused men to seek an
efficacious remedy everywhere. The idea began to spread
that, in order to obtain repose, it was necessary to create
a strong and durable power. After Cicero’s exile, the
aruspices had predicted that the monarchy was about to
recommence,<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c013'><sup>[278]</sup></a> and one did not need to be a prophet to anticipate
this. A few years later, the evil having increased still
more, the republican party itself, notwithstanding its repugnance,
was forced to have recourse to the violent remedy
of a temporary dictatorship. Pompey was appointed sole
consul, but Pompey had shown more than once that he had
neither the vigour nor the resolution necessary to overcome
anarchy entirely. A stronger arm and a more determined
will had to be sought elsewhere, and all eyes turned naturally
towards the conqueror of Gaul. His glory pointed him
out for this part; the hopes of some and the fears of others
called him to fulfil it; men’s minds became accustomed
every day to the idea that he would be the heir of the
republic, and the revolution that delivered up Rome to him
was more than half accomplished when he crossed the
Rubicon.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>II<br> <span class='c017'>THE VICTOR AND THE VANQUISHED</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c011'>AFTER PHARSALIA</h4>

<p class='c015'>The civil war interrupted the intercourse that Cicero
had kept up with Caesar during the Gallic war. He hesitated
for a long time to take part in it, and it was after long
indecision that the stings of conscience, the fear of public
opinion, and above all the example of his friends decided
him at length to start for Pompey’s camp. “As the ox follows
the herd,” said he, “I go to join the good citizens;”<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c013'><sup>[279]</sup></a>
but he went half-heartedly and without hope. After Pharsalia
he did not think it was possible to continue the
struggle: he said so openly in a council of the republican
chiefs held at Dyrrhachium, and he hastened to return to
Brundusium to hold himself at the disposal of the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c014'>What regret must he not have felt, if his thoughts went
back several years, and he remembered his triumphal
return from exile! In that very town, where he had been
received with so much rejoicing, he was constrained to disembark
furtively, to conceal his lictors, to avoid the crowd,
and only go out at night. He passed eleven months there,
the saddest of his life, in isolation and anxiety. He was distressed
on all sides, and his domestic affairs did not cause
him less sorrow than public events. His absence had completed
the disorder of his pecuniary affairs. When they
were most involved, he had been so imprudent as to lend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>what ready money he had to Pompey: the poniard of the
King of Egypt had at the same time carried off the debtor and
put an end to his power of paying. While he was trying to
procure some resources by selling his furniture and plate, he
discovered that his wife was acting in concert with his freedmen
to despoil him of what remained; he learnt that his
brother and his nephew, who had gone over to Caesar,
sought to justify themselves at his expense, and were working
to ruin him in order to save themselves; he saw Tullia,
his beloved daughter, again, but he found her sad and ill,
lamenting at the same time the misfortunes of her father,
and the infidelity of her husband. To these very real misfortunes
were joined at the same time imaginary troubles,
which caused him as much suffering; above all, he was
tormented by his habitual irresolution. Scarcely had he
set foot in Italy when he repented having come. According
to his habit, his restless imagination always puts
things at their worst, and he is ingenious in finding some
reason for discontent in everything that happens to him.
He laments when Antony wishes to force him to leave
Italy; when he is allowed to remain, he still laments, because
this exception made in his favour may injure his
reputation. If Caesar neglects to write to him, he is
alarmed; if he receives a letter from him, however friendly
it may be, he weighs all its expressions so carefully that he
discovers at last some motive for fear; even the broadest
and most complete amnesty does not entirely remove his
fears. “When a man pardons so easily,” he says, “it is
because he defers his vengeance.”<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c013'><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>At last, after a sojourn of nearly a year in that noisy and
pestilential town, he was permitted to leave Brundusium. He
returned to his fine country houses that he liked so much,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>and where he had been so happy; he found his books
again, he resumed his interrupted studies, he could appreciate
again those precious things which we enjoy without
thinking about them while they are ours, and only begin
to appreciate when we have lost them for a moment, namely,
security and leisure. He thought that nothing could equal
the charm of those first days passed tranquilly at Tusculum
after so many storms, and of that return to the quiet
pleasures of the mind for which he felt then that he was in
reality made. “Know,” he wrote to his friend Varro, “that
since my return I have been reconciled to my old friends:
I mean my books. In truth, if I fled from them, it was not
because I was angry with them, but I could not see them
without some confusion. It seemed to me that in engaging
in such stirring affairs, with doubtful allies, I have not followed
their precepts faithfully enough. They forgive me,
they recall me to their company; they tell me that you have
been wiser than I not to leave them. Now that I am restored
to their favour, I really hope that I shall support
more easily the evils that oppress us and those with which
we are threatened.”<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c013'><sup>[281]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>His conduct henceforth was clearly marked out. He
owed it to the great party he had served and defended to
hold aloof from the new government. He must seek in
philosophy and letters a useful employment for his activity,
and create an honourable retreat far from public affairs in
which he could no longer take part with honour. He well
understood this when he said: “Let us preserve at least a
partial liberty by knowing how to hide ourselves and keep
silence.”<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c013'><sup>[282]</sup></a> To keep silence and hide, was indeed the programme
that suited him best, as it did all those who had
submitted after Pharsalia. We shall see how far he was
faithful to it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>
  <h4 class='c011'>I.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It is very difficult to relinquish politics all at once. The
conduct of public affairs and the exercise of power, even
when they do not entirely content the mind, give a secondary
importance to other things, and life appears aimless
to him who can no longer employ himself in them. This is
what happened to Cicero. He was certainly very sincere
when, on leaving Brundusium, he undertook “to hide himself
entirely in literature”; but he had promised more than
he was able to perform. He soon wearied of repose, and
the pleasures of study at length seemed a little too quiet;
he listened with more curiosity to outside rumours, and, in
order to hear them better, quitted Tusculum and returned
to Rome. There he insensibly resumed his old habits; he
returned to the senate; his house was again open to all who
loved and cultivated letters; he began again to frequent the
houses of the friends he had in Caesar’s party, and by their
means resumed intercourse with Caesar himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were easily reconciled, notwithstanding all their
motives for ill will. The taste for intellectual pleasures
which united them was stronger than all political antipathy.
The first irritation over, they approached each other with
that ease that the habit and experience of society give, forgetting
or appearing to forget all the disagreements that
had separated them. Nevertheless these relations had become
more difficult than ever for Cicero. It was not only a
protector that he had found in his old fellow-student, it was
a master. There was no longer between them, as formerly,
an agreement or understanding that created reciprocal obligations;
there was the victor to whom the laws of war
permitted everything, and the vanquished who owed his life
to his clemency. The difficulty of the position was greater,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>because the more right the conqueror had to be exacting the
more public opinion commanded the conquered to be reserved.
It may be supposed that, at the time of the Gallic
war, Cicero defended Caesar’s projects through friendship or
conviction; but since he had shown that he disapproved his
cause by boldly expressing his opinions during the civil war,
the deference he might show to his wishes was nothing more
than a sort of base flattery, and a discreditable way of earning
his pardon. Already his sudden return from Pharsalia
had been much blamed. “I am not forgiven for living,”<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c013'><sup>[283]</sup></a>
said he. He was forgiven still less for his familiar relations
with Caesar’s friends. Good citizens murmured at seeing
him visit so assiduously the house of Balbus, go and dine
with the voluptuous Eutrapelus in company with Pansa or
Antony, and by the side of the actress Cytheris, take part
in the sumptuous feasts that Dolabella gave with the money
of the vanquished; on all sides the malevolent had their
eyes open to his weaknesses. He had, then, to satisfy at
once all parties, to hold with the conquerors and the conquered
for the sake of his reputation or his safety, to live
near the master without being too confident, and without
ever offending him, and in these dangerous relations to make
what he owed to his honour agree with what was needful
for his repose. It was a delicate situation, from which an
ordinary man would have had perhaps some trouble to extricate
himself, but which was not beyond the dexterity of
Cicero. To get out of it he had in his favour one marvellous
quality which prevented him from appearing too humble and
too base, even when he was constrained to flatter. Madame
de Sévigné has said somewhere: “Wit is a dignity.” This
saying is true in every sense; nothing helps one more to pass
through difficult times without baseness. When a man preserves
his wit before an absolute master, when he dares to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>joke and smile in the midst of the silence and terror of
others, he shows by this that the greatness of him to whom
he speaks does not intimidate him, and that he feels himself
sufficiently strong to support it. To remain master of oneself
in his presence is still a way of braving him, and it
seems to me that an exacting and suspicious despot ought
to be almost as displeased with those who dare to be witty
before him as with those he may suspect of having courage.
There is, then, below that courage of the soul that inspires
energetic resolutions, but near it, that courage of the
mind which is not to be despised, for it is often the sole
courage possible. After the defeat of the men of resolution,
the men of wit have their turn, and they still do some
service when the others can no longer do anything. As
they are crafty and supple, as they can raise their head
quickly after necessity has forced them to bend it, they
maintain themselves with a certain amount of honour in the
ruin of their party. Their raillery, however discreet it may
be, is a sort of protestation against the silence imposed on
all, and it at least prevents the loss of liberty of speech after
having lost the liberty of action. Wit is not then such a
trivial thing as people affect to consider it; it also has its
grandeur, and it may be that, after a great disaster, when all
is silent, downcast, and discouraged, it alone maintains
human dignity, which is in great danger of perishing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such was, very nearly, the part Cicero played at this time,
and we must acknowledge that it was not wanting in importance.
In that great city, submissive and mute, he alone
dared to speak. He began to do so early, he was still at
Brundusium, not knowing if he should obtain his pardon,
when he frightened Atticus by the freedom of his remarks.
Impunity naturally rendered him bolder, and after
his return to Rome he took scarcely any other precaution
than to make his raillery as agreeable and as witty as possible.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Caesar liked wit even when it was exercised at his
own expense. Instead of getting angry at Cicero’s jokes, he
made a collection of them, and in the midst of the war in
Spain, he ordered his correspondents to send them to him.
Cicero, who knew this, spoke without constraint. This freedom,
then so rare, drew all eyes upon him. He had never
had more society round him. The friends of Caesar frequented
his society readily to give themselves an air of
liberality and tolerance, after the example of their chief. As
he was the most illustrious survivor of the republican party
after the death of Pompey and Cato, the remaining partisans
of the republic crowded around him. People came to
see him from all sides, and all parties met in the mornings
in his vestibule. “I receive at the same time,” said
he, “the visits of many good citizens who are downcast, and
those of our joyful conquerors.”<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c013'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>This attention no doubt had something flattering in it,
and nothing must have given him more pleasure than to
have regained his importance. Let us remark, however,
that in regaining his position as a person of eminence, whose
friendship was sought and whose house was frequented, he
had already fallen short of the first part of the programme
that he had laid down for himself; the share he had, about
the same time, in the return of the exiles, soon made him
forget the other. He had given up hiding to respond to
Caesar’s advances. We are going to see how he ceased to
keep silence in order to thank him for his clemency.</p>

<p class='c014'>Caesar’s clemency is admired with good reason, and it
deserves the praises awarded to it. For the first time a ray
of humanity had been seen to shine in the midst of the
pitiless wars of the ancient world.</p>

<p class='c014'>No doubt about the extent of his rights had hitherto
entered the mind of the conqueror; he believed them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>have no limit, and exercised them without scruple. Who,
before Caesar, had thought of proclaiming and practising
consideration for the vanquished? He was the first who
declared that his vengeance would not outlast his victory,
and that he would not strike a disarmed enemy. What
adds to the admiration his conduct inspires is that he gave
this fine example of mildness and moderation in a time of
violence, between the proscriptions of Sulla and those of
Octavius; that he pardoned his enemies at the very moment
that they were massacring his soldiers who were prisoners,
and burning his sailors alive with their ships. We must not,
however, exaggerate, and history should not be a panegyric.
Without attempting to diminish Caesar’s glory, we may be
allowed to ask what motive he had in pardoning the vanquished,
and it is right to inquire how and within what
limits he exercised his clemency.</p>

<p class='c014'>Curio, one of his closest friends, said one day to Cicero,
in a private conversation, that Caesar was cruel by nature,
and that he had only spared his enemies to preserve the
affection of the people;<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c013'><sup>[285]</sup></a> but the sceptic Curio was very
much disposed, like Caelius, to look at people always on
their bad side: he has certainly calumniated his chief. The
truth is that Caesar was clement both by nature and policy:
<i><span lang="la">pro natura et pro instituto</span></i>;<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c013'><sup>[286]</sup></a> the continuator of his <em>Commentaries</em>,
who knew him well, says so. Now, if the heart
does not change, policy often changes with circumstances.
When a man is good solely by nature he is good always;
but when the reflection which calculates the good effect
clemency will produce, and the advantage which may be
drawn from it, is added to the natural instinct that inclines
to clemency, it may happen that a man may become less
clement as soon as he has less interest to be so. He who
becomes gentle and humane, by policy, in order to draw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>men towards him, would become cruel, by policy also, if he
had need of intimidating them. This happened to Caesar,
and when we study his life closely we find that his clemency
suffered more than one eclipse. I do not think that he
committed any gratuitous cruelties for the sake of committing
them, as so many of his contemporaries did; but
neither did he refrain when he found some advantage in
them. While he was praetor in Spain he sometimes stormed
towns which were willing to surrender, in order to have a
pretext for sacking them. In Gaul he never hesitated to
terrify his enemies by fearful vengeance; we see him behead
the whole senate of the Veneti, massacre the Usipetes and
the Tencteri, sell the forty thousand inhabitants of Genabum
for slaves at one time, and cut off the hands of all in
Uxellodunum who had taken up arms against him. And
did he not keep in prison five whole years that heroic chief
of the Arverni, that Vercingetorix who was an adversary so
worthy of him, that he might coolly give the order to
slaughter him on the day of his triumph? Even at the
time of the civil war and when he was fighting his fellow-citizens,
he got tired of pardoning. When he saw that his
system of clemency did not disarm his enemies, he gave it
up, and their obstinacy, which surprised him, at last made
him cruel. As the struggle was prolonged it took darker
colours on both sides. The war between the republicans
exasperated by their defeats and the conqueror furious at
their resistance, became merciless. After Thapsus, Caesar
set the example of punishments, and his army, inspired by
his anger, slaughtered the vanquished before his face. He
had proclaimed, when starting on his last expedition into
Spain, that his clemency was exhausted, and that all who did
not lay down their arms should be put to death. Therefore
the battle of Munda was terrible. Dio relates that both
armies attacked with silent rage, and that instead of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>war-songs that usually resounded, one only heard at intervals
the words: “strike and kill.” When the fight was over the
massacre began. The eldest son of Pompey, who had succeeded
in escaping, was tracked in the forest for several
days and killed without mercy, like the Vendean chiefs in
our wars of the Bocage.</p>

<p class='c014'>The most glorious moment of Caesar’s clemency was just
after the battle of Pharsalia. He had proclaimed in advance
when he entered Italy that the proscriptions would not
recommence. “I will not imitate Sulla,” said he in a celebrated
letter, which no doubt was widely circulated. “Let
us introduce a new way of conquering, and seek our safety
in clemency and mildness.”<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c013'><sup>[287]</sup></a> At first he did not belie these
fair words. After the victory, he ordered the soldiers to
spare their fellow-citizens, and on the battle-field itself he
gave his hand to Brutus and many others. It is wrong
however to think that there was a general amnesty at that
moment.<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c013'><sup>[288]</sup></a> On the contrary, an edict of Antony, who
governed Rome in the absence of Caesar, strictly forbade
any Pompeian to return to Italy without having obtained
permission. Cicero and Laelius, from whom there was
nothing to fear, were alone excepted. Many others returned
afterwards, but they were only recalled individually and by
special decree. This was a means for Caesar to make the
most of his clemency. Usually pardons thus given separately
were not given gratuitously, they were almost always
bought by the exiles with a part of their property. Besides,
they were seldom complete at first; the exiles were allowed
to return to Sicily, then to Italy, before opening to them
completely the gates of Rome. These steps cleverly managed,
by multiplying the number of favours granted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Caesar, did not allow public admiration to cool. Each
time the chorus of flatterers recommenced their praises, and
did not cease to celebrate the generosity of the victor.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was, then, after Pharsalia, a certain number of
exiles in Greece and in Asia who were waiting impatiently
for permission to return home, and who did not all obtain
it. Cicero’s letters do us the good office of making us
acquainted with some of them. They are people of all conditions
and fortunes, merchants and farmers of the taxes as
well as great nobles. By the side of a Marcellus, a Torquatus
and a Domitius there are entirely unknown persons
like Trebianus and Toranius, which shows that Caesar’s
vengeance did not stop at the heads of the party. We find
also among them three writers, and it is worthy of notice
that they were perhaps the most hardly treated. One of
them, T. Ampius, was a fiery republican who did not show
so much firmness in exile as one would have expected. He
was occupied in writing a history of illustrious men, and it
seems that he did not profit much by the good examples he
found there. We know the other two, who are not much
alike, better: they were the Etruscan Caecina, a merchant
and a wit, and the scholar Nigidius Figulus. Nigidius, who
was compared with Varro for the extent of his attainments,
and who was, like him, at once philosopher, grammarian,
astronomer, physicist, rhetorician and lawyer, had particularly
struck his contemporaries by the extent of his theological
researches. As he was seen to be much occupied with the
doctrines of the Chaldeans and the followers of Orpheus, he
passed for a great magician. It was believed that he predicted
the future, and he was suspected of raising the dead.
So many occupations, of such various kinds, did not prevent
him taking an interest in the affairs of his country. It was
not thought, then, that a scholar was excused from performing
the duties of a citizen. He solicited and obtained public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>offices: he was praetor in difficult times, and was noticed
for his energy. When Caesar entered Italy, Nigidius, faithful
to the maxim of his master Pythagoras, which commands
the sage to carry help to the law when it is menaced,
hastened to leave his books, and was one of the principal combatants
at Pharsalia. Caecina had appeared at first as firm
as Nigidius, and like him was conspicuous for his republican
ardour. Not content with taking up arms against Caesar,
he had, besides, insulted him in a pamphlet at the beginning
of the war: but he was as weak as he was violent, he could
not bear exile. This frivolous and worldly man had need
of the pleasures of Rome, and was disconsolate at being
deprived of them. To obtain his pardon, he formed the
idea of writing a new work destined to contradict the old
one, and to obliterate its bad effect. He had called it his
<em>Querelae</em>, and this title indicates well enough its character.
In it he lavished eulogies on Caesar without measure, and
yet he was always afraid he had not said enough. “I
tremble in all my limbs,” said he to Cicero, “when I ask
myself if he will be satisfied.”<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c013'><sup>[289]</sup></a> So much humiliation and
baseness succeeded in softening the victor, and while he
relentlessly left the energetic Nigidius, who could not flatter,
to die in exile, he allowed Caecina to approach Italy, and
settle down in Sicily.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero had become the consoler of all these exiles, and
employed his influence in ameliorating their condition. He
served them all with the same zeal, although there were
some among them of whom he had reason to complain;
but he no longer remembered their offences when he saw
their misfortunes. In writing to them he showed a graceful
tact in accommodating his language to their situation and
feelings, caring little whether he was consistent with himself,
provided he could console them and be useful to them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>He told those who lamented that they were kept away from
Rome, that they were wrong in wishing to return, and that
it was better simply to hear reports of the misfortunes of the
republic than to see them with their eyes; he wrote in the
opposite strain to those who supported exile too courageously,
and would not beg for recall, to the great despair of
their families. When he met with a too servile eagerness in
anticipating and entreating Caesar’s kindness, he did not
hesitate to blame it, and with infinite tact recalled the unfortunate
to that self-respect which they had forgotten. If,
on the contrary, he saw some one disposed to commit a
heroic imprudence and to attempt a useless and dangerous
move, he hastened to restrain this burst of idle courage, and
preached prudence and resignation. He did not spare his
pains during this time. He went to see the friends of the
master, or if necessary, he tried to see the master himself,
although it was very difficult to approach a man who had
the affairs of the whole world on his shoulders. He begged,
he promised, he wearied with his supplications and was almost
always successful, for Caesar was anxious to draw him more
and more into his party by the favours he granted him.
The favour once obtained, he wished to be the first to
announce it to the exile, who impatiently awaited it; he
heartily congratulated him and added to his compliments a
few of those counsels of moderation and silence which he
readily gave to others, but which he did not always follow
himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no more important personage among these
exiles than the former consul Marcellus; neither was there
any whom Caesar had so much reason to hate. By a sort
of cruel bravado, Marcellus had had an inhabitant of Como
beaten with rods, in order to show what value he set upon
the rights that Caesar had granted to that city. After
Pharsalia, he had retired to Mitylene and did not think of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>returning, when his relatives and Cicero took it into their
heads to obtain his pardon. While taking the first steps
they met with an unexpected obstacle: they thought they
only had to entreat Caesar, and they had to begin by
appeasing Marcellus. He was an energetic man whom the
ill success of his cause had not dispirited, a veritable philosopher,
who had reconciled himself to exile, an obstinate
republican, who would not return to Rome to see her a
slave. Quite a long negotiation was necessary before he
would consent to allow them to crave anything for him
from the conqueror, and even then he allowed it with a very
bad grace. When we read the letters that Cicero wrote to
him on this occasion, we greatly admire his skill, but
have some difficulty in understanding the motives of his
persistence. We ask with surprise why he took more
interest in the return of Marcellus than did Marcellus himself.
They had never been very closely connected; Cicero
did not stand upon ceremony in blaming his obstinacy, and
we know that those stiff and self-willed characters did not
suit him. He must have had then some stronger motive
than affection to be so anxious for Marcellus’ return to
Rome. This motive, which he does not mention, but which
we can guess, was the fear he had of public opinion. He
well knew that he was reproached with not having done
enough for his cause, and at times he accused himself of
having abandoned it too quickly. When, in the midst of
Rome, where he passed his time so gaily at those sumptuous
dinners that Hirtius and Dolabella gave him, and to which
he went, he said, to enliven his slavery a little; when he
came to think of those brave men who had been killed in
Africa and Spain, or who were living in exile in some dull
and unknown town in Greece, he was angry with himself for
not being with them, and the thought of their sufferings
often troubled his pleasures. That is the reason why he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>worked with so much ardour for their return. It was of
importance to him to diminish the number of those whose
miseries formed a disagreeable contrast to the happiness
that he enjoyed, or who appeared to condemn his submission
by their haughty attitude. Every time that an exile
returned to Rome, it seemed to Cicero as though he got rid
of some remorse and escaped the reproaches of the ill-natured.
Therefore, when he had obtained, contrary to his
expectation, the pardon of Marcellus, his joy knew no
bounds. It went so far as to make him forget that resolution
he had taken to keep silence to which he had been
faithful during two years. He spoke in the senate to thank
Caesar, and delivered the celebrated speech which remains
to us.<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c013'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The reputation of this speech has had very diverse
fortunes. It was long unreservedly admired, and, in the
last century, the worthy Rollin regarded it as the model and
perfection of eloquence; but this enthusiasm has much
diminished since we have become less appreciative of the
art of praising princes with delicacy, and value free and
open speech more highly than the most ingenious flattery.
We should certainly sometimes wish for a little more dignity
in this speech, and we are especially shocked at the manner
in which embarrassing recollections of the civil war are
treated in it. He should have said nothing of them, or have
spoken out more boldly. Ought he, for example, to hide
the motives that the republicans had for taking up arms
and reduce the whole struggle to a conflict between two
eminent men? Was it the time, after the defeat of Pompey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>to sacrifice him to Caesar, and to assert with so much
assurance that he would have used the victory less well?
That we may be able to judge less severely the concessions
that Cicero thought himself obliged to make to the
victorious party, we must recall the circumstances in which
this speech was delivered. It was the first time he had
spoken in public since Pharsalia. In that senate, purged
by Caesar and filled with his creatures, free speech had not
yet been heard. The friends and admirers of the master
alone spoke, and whatever excess we may find in the
praises that Cicero gives him, we may rest assured that all
these flatteries must have seemed lukewarm compared with
those heard every day. Let us add that, as no one had
yet dared to make a trial of Caesar’s forbearance, its limits
were not exactly known. Now it is natural, that he who does
not exactly know where rashness begins has a little dread of
becoming rash. When one does not know the bounds of the
liberty that is permitted, the fear of overstepping them sometimes
prevents their being reached at all. Besides, this orator
who spoke for an exile was himself one of the vanquished.
He knew the whole extent of the rights that victory then
conferred, and he did not try to hide it. “We have been
defeated,” he said to Caesar, “you might legitimately put
us all to death.”<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c013'><sup>[291]</sup></a> At the present time things are quite
different. Humanity has lessened these pitiless rights, and
the conquered, who knows it, does not give way so completely;
from the moment that he does not run the same
risks it is easy for him to have more courage; but when he
found himself before a master who had absolute power over
him, when he knew that he only held liberty and life by a
favour always revocable, he could not speak with the same
boldness, and it would not be just to call the reserve imposed
by such a perilous position, timidity. There is yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>one other way, simpler and probably truer than the others,
of explaining these rather too exaggerated praises with
which Cicero has been reproached, namely, to acknowledge
that they were sincere. The greater the rights of the
conqueror, the more becoming it was in him to renounce
them, and the merit was still greater when they were
renounced in favour of a man whom there were legitimate
reasons for hating. Accordingly, the excitement was very
great among the senators when they saw Caesar pardon his
personal enemy, and Cicero shared it. What proves that
all these effusions of joy and thankfulness, with which his
speech is filled, were not simply oratorical embellishments,
is that we find them in a letter which he addressed to
Sulpicius, and which was not written for the public. “That
day seemed to me so grand,” said he, relating that memorable
sitting of the senate, “that I thought I saw the republic
rise again.”<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c013'><sup>[292]</sup></a> This was going very far, and indeed nothing
less resembled the revival of the republic than this arbitrary
act of a despot in pardoning men who were only guilty of
having served their country. This violent hyperbole is none
the less a proof of the deep and sincere emotion that
Caesar’s clemency caused Cicero. We know how open that
sensitive nature was to the impressions of the moment. He
usually allows himself to be seized so forcibly by admiration
or hatred, that he seldom keeps within bounds in expressing
them. Hence came, in the speech for Marcellus, some
hyperbolical eulogies and an excess of complimentary phrases
which it is easy to account for, although one would rather
not have found them there.</p>

<p class='c014'>These reservations being made, nothing remains but to
admire. Cicero’s speech does not contain only flatteries, as
is asserted, and those who read it carefully and without prejudice
will find something else. After thanking Caesar for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>clemency, he takes the liberty of telling him a few truths and
giving him some advice. This second part, which is somewhat
hidden now under the splendour of the other, is
much more curious, although less striking, and must have
produced more effect in its time. Although he revised his
work before publishing it, as was usual with him, he must
have preserved the movement of improvisation. If he had
not at first found those grand periods, the most sonorous
and pompous of the Latin tongue, it is at least probable
that he has not changed very much the order of the
ideas and the coherency of the speech. We feel that he
becomes excited and warmed by degrees, and in proportion
as he advances he becomes more daring. The success of
his eloquence, of which they had been deprived so long,
the applause of his friends, the admiration and surprise of
the new senators who had not yet heard him, that sort of
transport a man feels in speaking when he perceives he is
listened to; in sum, the place itself where he was speaking,
those walls of the senate house to which he alluded in his
discourse, and which guarded the memory of so many
eloquent and free voices,—all this put him in heart again.
He forgot the timid precautions of the commencement, and
boldness came with success. Was it not attacking absolute
power indirectly when he said: “I am grieved to think that
the destiny of the republic, which ought to be immortal,
depends entirely on the life of one man who must some time
die.”<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c013'><sup>[293]</sup></a> And what can we think of that other saying, still
sharper, almost cruel? “You have done much to gain the
admiration of men; you have not done enough to deserve
their praises.”<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c013'><sup>[294]</sup></a> What must Caesar do in order that the future
may praise him as much as it admires him? He must
change that which exists: “The republic cannot remain as
it is.” He does not explain himself, but we guess what he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>wants. He wants liberty, not that entire liberty that they
had enjoyed up to Pharsalia, but a moderate and regulated
liberty, compatible with a strong and victorious government,
the sole liberty that Rome could support. It is plain that
at this moment Cicero did not think it impossible to make a
compromise between Caesar and liberty. Could not a man
who so ostentatiously renounced one of the least disputed
rights of victory be tempted to renounce the others later?
And when he was seen to be so clement and generous
towards private individuals, was it forbidden to think that
he might one day show the same liberality to his country?
However weak this hope might be, as there was then no
other, an honest man and a good citizen would not let it
be lost, and it was his duty to encourage Caesar by all
possible means to realize it. They were not then to
blame in praising him without restraint for what he had
done, in order to urge him to do still more, and it seems to
me that the praises Cicero heaps on him, when we think of
the intention he had in giving them, lose a little of that
look of slavishness with which they have been reproached.</p>

<p class='c014'>Caesar listened to the compliments with pleasure and to
the advice without anger. He was too pleased that Cicero
had at last broken silence to think of being angry at what
he had said. It was important to him that this statesman,
on whom all eyes were fixed, should re-enter public life in
some way or other. While that powerful voice persisted in
remaining mute it seemed to protest against the new government.
By not even attempting to contradict him, it let it
be thought it had not the liberty to do so, and made the
slavery appear heavier. He was then so content to hear
Cicero’s voice again that he let him say what he liked.
Cicero quickly perceived it and took advantage of it. From
this moment, when he speaks in public, we feel that he is
more at his ease. His tone becomes firmer, and he concerns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>himself less about compliments and eulogies. With the
speech for Marcellus, he had tried what liberties he could
take. Having once felt his ground, he was more sure of
his steps and walked with confidence.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such was the position of Cicero during Caesar’s dictatorship;
we see clearly that it was not so humble as has been
asserted, and that, in a time of despotism, he was able to
render some services to liberty. These services have been
generally ill appreciated, and I am not surprised at it. It
is with men something as it is with works of art: when we
see them at a distance we are only struck with the bold
situations and well-drawn attitudes; the details and finer
shades escape us. We can well understand those who give
themselves up entirely to the conqueror like Curio or Antony,
or those who constantly resist him like Labienus and Cato.
As to those ingenious and flexible minds who fly from all
extremes, who live adroitly between submission and revolt,
who turn difficulties rather than force them, who do not
refuse to pay with a few flatteries for the right of telling a
few truths, we are always tempted to be severe towards
them. As we cannot clearly distinguish their attitude at
the distance from which we regard them, their smallest
subserviencies appear to be cowardice, and they seem to
be prostrating themselves when they are only bowing. It is
only by drawing near them, that is to say by studying the
facts closer, that we succeed in rendering them justice. I
think that this minute study is not unfavourable to Cicero,
and that he was not mistaken when he said later, speaking
of this period of his life, that his slavery had not been without
some honour: <i><span lang="la">quievi cum aliqua dignitate</span></i>.<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c013'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>
  <h4 class='c011'>II.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In giving an account of the relations of Cicero and Caesar
after Pharsalia, I have purposely omitted to speak of the
courteous contest they had about Cato. It was such a
curious incident that it seems to me to be worth the
trouble of being studied apart, and in order to understand
better the sentiments that each of the two brought into this
contest, perhaps it will not be amiss to begin by making the
acquaintance of the person who was the subject of the
dispute.</p>

<p class='c014'>A sufficiently correct idea is generally formed of Cato by
us, and those who attack him as well as those who admire
him are very nearly agreed upon the principal features of
his character. He was not one of those elusive and many-sided
natures like Cicero, that it is so difficult to seize. On
the contrary, no one was ever more outspoken, more
uniform, than he, and there is no figure in history whose
good and bad qualities are so clearly marked. The only
danger for those who study him is to be tempted to exaggerate
still more this bold relief. With a little intention
it is easy to make an obstinate block of this obstinate man,
a boor and brute of this frank and sincere man; that is to
say, to draw the caricature and not the portrait of Cato.
To avoid falling into this extreme, it will be proper, before
speaking of him, to read again a short letter that he
addressed to Cicero when proconsul of Cilicia.<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c013'><sup>[296]</sup></a> This note
is all that remains to us of Cato, and I should be surprised
if it did not very much astonish those who have a preconceived
notion of him. There is neither rudeness nor
brutality in it, but on the contrary much refinement and wit.
The occasion of the letter was a very difficult one: it was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>question of refusing Cicero a favour that he very much
wished to obtain. He had had in his old age the aspiration
to become a conqueror, and he asked the senate to vote a
thanksgiving to the gods for the success of the campaign he
had just made. The senate in general showed deference
to this caprice, Cato almost alone resisted; but he did not
wish to fall out with Cicero, and the letter he wrote to
justify his refusal is a masterpiece of dexterity. He shows
him that in opposing his demand, he understands the
interests of his glory, better than he does himself. If he
will not thank the gods for the successes Cicero has
obtained, it is because he thinks that Cicero owes them to
himself alone. Is it not better to give him all the honour
than to attribute it to chance, or the protection of heaven?
This is certainly a very amiable way of refusing, and one
that did not leave Cicero an excuse for getting angry, discontented
though he was. Cato, then, was a man of wit at
odd moments, although at first sight we might have some
difficulty in supposing so. His character had become
supple by the study of Greek literature; he lived in the
midst of an elegant society, and he had unconsciously taken
something from it. This is what that witty letter makes us
suspect, and we must remember it, and take care to read it
again every time we are tempted to fancy him an ill-bred
rustic.</p>

<p class='c014'>We must, however, admit that usually he was stiff and
stubborn, hard to himself, and severe on others. That was
the turn of his humour; he added to it by his self-will.
Nature is not alone to blame for those self-willed and
absolute characters that we meet with; a certain pursuit of
quaint originality and a little self-complacency, very often
make us aid nature and bring it out more vigorously. Cato
was led into this defect by the very name he bore. The
example of his illustrious grandfather was always before his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>eyes, and his single study was to resemble him, without
taking into account the difference of times and men. In
imitating we exaggerate. There is always a little effort and
excess in the virtues we try to reproduce. We take only
the most salient points of the model, and neglect the others
which tone them down. This happened with Cato, and
Cicero justly blames him for imitating only the rough and
hard sides of his grandfather. “If you let the austerity of
your behaviour take a few tints of his gay and easy manners,
your good qualities would be more pleasing.”<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c013'><sup>[297]</sup></a> It is certain
that there was in the old Cato a dash of piquant animation,
of rustic gaiety, of bantering good-nature, that his grandson
did not have. He only shared with him his roughness and
obstinacy, which he pushed to extremes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of all excesses the most dangerous perhaps is the excess
of good; it is at least that of which it is most difficult to
correct oneself, for the culprit applauds himself, and no one
dares to blame him. Cato’s great defect was that he never
knew moderation. By dint of wishing to be firm in his
opinion, he became deaf to the advice of his friends and the
lessons of experience. The practical conduct of life, that
imperious mistress, to speak like Bossuet, had no hold upon
him. His energy often went to the length of obstinacy,
and his sense of honour was sometimes in fault by being
too scrupulous. This extreme delicacy prevented him
succeeding when he canvassed for public offices. The
people were very exacting towards those who asked for
their votes. During the rest of the year they allowed themselves
to be driven and ill-used, but on election day they
knew they were masters and took pleasure in showing it.
They could only be gained by flattering all their caprices.
Cicero often laughed at those unfortunate and deferential
candidates (<i><span lang="la">natio officiosissima candidatorum</span></i>), who go in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>morning knocking at every door, who pass their time in
paying visits and compliments, who make it a duty to
accompany the generals when they enter or leave Rome,
who form the retinue of all the influential orators, and who
are forced to have infinite consideration and respect for
everybody. Among the common people, upon whom after
all the election depended, the more honest wished to be
flattered, the rest required to be bought. Cato was not the
man to do either the one or the other. He would neither
flatter nor lie; still less would he consent to pay. When
he was pressed to offer those repasts and those presents
that for so long candidates had not dared to refuse, he
answered bluntly: “Are you bargaining for pleasures with
debauched young men, or asking the government of the
world of the Roman people?” And he did not cease
repeating this maxim, “that it is only a man’s merits which
must solicit.”<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c013'><sup>[298]</sup></a> A hard saying! said Cicero, and one they
were not accustomed to hear at a time when all offices
were for sale. It displeased the people, who profited by
this venality, and Cato, who persisted in only soliciting on
his merits, was almost always vanquished by those who
solicited with their money.</p>

<p class='c014'>Characters of this sort, honest and outspoken, are met
with, in different degrees, in private as well as in public
life, and for this reason they belong to the domain of
comedy as well as to that of history. If I were not afraid
of failing in respect towards the gravity of the personage I
am studying, I should say that this haughty response that I
have just quoted, makes me think involuntarily of one of
the finest creations of our theatre. It is a Cato that
Molière wished to paint in the <em>Misanthrope</em>. We are here
only concerned with the fortune of a private individual, and
not with the government of the world, we have only to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>with a lawsuit; but in his position, the Cato of the Comedy
speaks just like the other. He will not submit to customs
that he does not approve of. Even at the risk of losing his
case he will not visit the judges, and when people say to
him: “And who do you then intend to solicit for you?” he
answers as haughtily as Cato: “Who do I intend? Reason,
my just cause, and equity.” Whatever we may feel, these
personages always inspire a great respect. We have not the
heart to blame them, but, nevertheless, we must have the
courage to do so. Honesty, honour, liberty, all noble causes
in fine, cannot well be defended with this exaggerated and
strait-laced rigour. They have disadvantages enough by
themselves in their struggle with corruption and licence,
without making them more unpleasing still by a useless
stiffness and severity. To multiply scruples is to disarm
virtue. It is quite enough that she is forced to be grave;
why wish to make her repulsive? Without sacrificing anything
of principle, there are points on which she ought to
give way to men in order to rule them. What proves that
those men, who boast of never giving way, are wrong is that
they are not as inflexible as they suppose, and that, in spite
of their resistance, they always end by making some concessions.
That austere, that stern Alceste, is a member of
society after all, and of the best. He lives at court, and
we can see very well what he is. I do not say only by his
manners and appearance, although I imagine <em>the man with
the green ribbons</em> dressed with taste and elegance, but by
those turns of phrase he employs, by those polite evasions
which are also lies, and which he will not endure in Philinte.
Before breaking out against the nobleman of the sonnet he
uses adroit formulas where we only catch a glimpse of the
truth:</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you find anything amiss in my sonnet?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not say that.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>What is this “<em>I do not say that</em>,” which he repeats so often,
but a blameworthy compliance and weakness, if we judge it
with the rigour of the misanthrope? Rousseau severely
reproaches Alceste for it, and I do not think that Alceste,
if he remains faithful to his principles, can find any reply to
Rousseau; it would not be difficult either to point out contradictions
of the same kind in Cato. This stern enemy of
intrigue, who at first will do nothing for the success of his
candidature, ends by canvassing: he went to the Campus
Martius like everybody else, to shake hands with the citizens
and ask for their votes. “What!” says Cicero to him ironically,
whom these inconsistencies put into good humour, “is
it your business to come and ask for my vote? Is it not
rather I who ought to thank a man of your merit who wishes
to brave fatigue and dangers for me?”<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c013'><sup>[299]</sup></a> This stern enemy
of lying did more: he had one of those slaves called <i><span lang="la">nomenclatores</span></i>
who knew the name and profession of every citizen
of Rome, and he used him like the rest, to make the poor
electors believe that he knew them. “Is not this cheating
and deceiving the public?” said Cicero, and he was not
wrong. The saddest thing is that these concessions, that
compromise the dignity and unity of a character, are of no
use: they are generally made with a bad grace, and too
late; they do not efface the remembrance of past rudeness,
and gain nobody. Notwithstanding his tardy solicitations
and the aid of his <i><span lang="la">nomenclator</span></i>, Cato did not attain the
consulship, and Cicero severely blames the awkwardness
that made him fail. No doubt he could do without being
consul; but the republic had need that he should be consul,
and in the eyes of many good citizens, to favour by refinements
of scrupulosity and exaggerations of honour the
triumph of the worst men was almost to abandon and
betray it.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>It is easy to understand these excesses and exaggerations
in a man who intends <em>to fly the approach of humankind</em>, like
Alceste; but they are unpardonable in one who wishes to
live with men, and still more so in one who aspires to govern
them. The government of men is a nice and difficult matter
which requires a man not to begin by repelling those whom
he is desirous of leading. Certainly he ought to intend to
make them better, but it is necessary to begin by taking
them as they are. The first law of politics is to aim only at
the possible. Cato often overlooked this law. He could
not condescend to those attentions without which one cannot
govern the people; he had not sufficient flexibility of
character nor that turn for honourable intrigue which make
a man succeed in the things he undertakes; he wanted
some of that pliancy that brings opposing pretensions
together, calms jealous rivalries, and groups people divided
by humours, opinions and interests around one man. He
could only be a striking protest against the manners of his
time; he was not the head of a party. Let us venture to
say, notwithstanding the respect we feel for him, that his
spirit was obstinate because his mind was narrow. He did
not at first distinguish the points on which a man should
give way and those that ought to be defended to the last.
A disciple of the Stoics, who said that all faults are equal,
that is, according to Cicero’s joke, that it is as wrong to kill
a fowl needlessly as to strangle one’s father, he had applied
this hard and strange theory to politics. His mind being
restricted to the merest legality, he defended the smallest
things with tiresome obstinacy. His admiration of the
past knew no discrimination. He imitated the ancient
costumes as he followed the old maxims, and he affected
not to wear a tunic under his toga because Camillus did not
wear one. His want of breadth of mind, his narrow and
obstinate zeal were more than once hurtful to the republic.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Plutarch reproaches him with having thrown Pompey into
Caesar’s arms by refusing some unimportant gratifications
of his vanity. Cicero blames him for having dissatisfied
the knights whom he had had so much trouble to conciliate
with the senate. No doubt the knights made unreasonable
demands, but he should have conceded everything rather
than let them give Caesar the support of their immense
wealth. It was on this occasion that Cicero said of him:
“He thinks he is in the republic of Plato and not in the
mud of Romulus,”<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c013'><sup>[300]</sup></a> and this saying is still that which best
characterizes that clumsy policy that, by asking too much of
men, ends by getting nothing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cato’s natural character was that of opposition. He did
not understand how to discipline and lead a party, but he
was admirable when it was a question of making head against
an adversary. To conquer him, he employed a tactic in
which he often succeeded: when he saw that a decision
that seemed to him fatal, was about to be taken, and that
it was necessary at any price to prevent the people voting,
he began to speak and did not leave off. Plutarch says
that he could speak for a whole day without fatigue. Nothing
deterred him, neither murmurs, cries, nor threats.
Sometimes a lictor would pull him down from the rostrum,
but as soon as he was free he went up again. One day the
tribune Trebonius got so much out of patience with this
resistance that he had him led off to prison: Cato, without
being disconcerted, continued his speech while going along,
and the crowd followed him to listen. It is to be remarked
that he was never really unpopular: the common people,
who love courage, were at last mastered by this steady
coolness and this unconquerable energy. It sometimes
happened that they declared themselves in his favour,
contrary to their interests and preferences, and Caesar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>all-powerful with the populace, dreaded nevertheless the
freaks of Cato.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is none the less true, as I have already said, that Cato
could not be the head of a party, and what is more deplorable
is, that the party for which he fought had no head. It
was an assemblage of men of capacity and of dignified personages,
none of whom had the necessary qualities to take the
lead of the rest. Not to mention Pompey, who was only a
doubtful and distrusted ally, among the others, Scipio repelled
every one by his haughtiness and cruelty; Appius Claudius
was only a credulous augur who believed in the sacred
chickens; Marcellus was wanting in pliability and urbanity,
and was himself aware that scarcely anybody liked him;
Servius Sulpicius had all the weaknesses of a punctilious
lawyer; and lastly, Cicero and Cato erred in opposite directions,
and it would have been necessary to unite them both,
or modify them one by the other in order to have a complete
politician. There were, therefore, only brilliant personalities
and no head in the republican party before Pharsalia, and
we may even say that, as this jealous selfishness and these
rival vanities were ill blended, there was scarcely a party.</p>

<p class='c014'>The civil war, which was a stumbling-block for so many
others, which laid bare so many littlenesses and so much
cowardice, revealed, on the other hand, all the goodness and
all the greatness of Cato. A sort of crisis then took place
in his character. As in certain maladies the approach of
the last moments gives more elevation and lucidity to the
mind, so, it seems, that at the threat of that great catastrophe
which was about to engulf the free institutions of Rome,
Cato’s honest soul was yet further purified, and that his
intelligence took a juster view of the situation from the
feeling of the public dangers. While fear makes others go
to extremes, he restrains the usual violence of his conduct,
and, while thinking of the dangers the republic is running,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>he becomes all at once discreet and moderate. He who was
always ready to attempt useless resistance, advises giving
way to Caesar; he wishes them to grant all his demands;
he resigns himself to all concessions in order to avoid civil
war. When it breaks out he submits to it with sorrow, and
tries by all means to diminish its horrors. Every time he
is consulted he is on the side of moderation and mildness.
In the midst of those young men, the heroes of the polished
society of Rome, among those lettered and elegant wits, it
is the rugged Cato who defends the cause of humanity. He
compelled the decision, in spite of the outbursts of the
fiery Pompeians, that no town shall be sacked, no citizen
be killed off the field of battle. It seems that the approach
of the calamities he foresaw, softened that energetic heart.
On the evening of the battle of Dyrrhachium, while every
one was rejoicing in Pompey’s camp, Cato alone, seeing the
corpses of so many Romans lying on the ground, wept:
noble tears, worthy of being compared with those that Scipio
shed over the ruins of Carthage, the memory of which antiquity
so often recalled! In the camp at Pharsalia, he severely
blamed those who spoke only of massacre and proscription
and divided among themselves in advance the houses and
lands of the conquered. It is true that after the defeat,
when the greater number of those wild schemers were at
Caesar’s knees, Cato went everywhere to stir him up enemies
and to revive the civil wars in all the ends of the earth. Just
as he had wished them to yield before the battle, so was
he determined not to submit when there was no more hope
of freedom. We know his heroic resistance in Africa, not
only against Caesar, but against the furious men of the republican
party, who were always ready to commit some excess.
We know how he would not accept the pardon of the
victor after Thapsus, when he saw that all was lost, and killed
himself at Utica.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>His death made an immense impression in all the Roman
world. It put to the blush those who were beginning to
accustom themselves to slavery; it gave a sort of new impulse
to the discouraged republicans, and revived opposition.
During his life-time, Cato had not always rendered good
service to his party; he was very useful to it after his death.
The proscribed cause had henceforth its ideal and its martyr.
Its remaining partisans united and sheltered themselves
under that great name. At Rome especially, in that great,
unquiet, restless city, where so many men bowed the head
without submitting, his glorification became the ordinary
theme of the discontented. “The battle raged round the
body of Cato,” says M. Mommsen, “as at Troy it had raged
around that of Patroclus.” Fabius Gallus, Brutus, Cicero,
and many others no doubt whom we do not know, wrote
his eulogy. Cicero began his at the request of Brutus. At
first he was repelled by the difficulty of the subject: “This
is a work for Archimedes,” said he;<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c013'><sup>[301]</sup></a> but as he advanced,
he took a liking to his work and finished it with a sort of
enthusiasm. This book has not come down to us: we only
know that Cicero made a complete and unreserved apology
for Cato. “he raises him to the skies,”<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c013'><sup>[302]</sup></a> says Tacitus.
They had, however, disagreed more than once, and he
speaks of him without much consideration in many passages
of his correspondence; but, as often happens, death reconciled
everything. Besides, Cicero, who reproached himself
with not having done enough for his party, was happy to
find an opportunity of paying his debt. His book, that the
name of the author and that of the hero recommended at
once, had so great a success that Caesar was uneasy and
discontented about it. He took care, however, not to show
his ill-humour; on the contrary, he hastened to write a
flattering letter to Cicero to congratulate him on the talent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>he had displayed in his work. “In reading it,” he told him,
“I feel that I become more eloquent.”<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c013'><sup>[303]</sup></a> Instead of employing
any rigorous measure, as was to be feared, he thought
that the pen alone, according to the expression of Tacitus,
ought to avenge the attacks that the pen had made. By
his order, his lieutenant and friend Hirtius addressed a long
letter to Cicero, which was published, and in which he
controverted his book. Later, as this answer was not
thought sufficient, Caesar himself entered the lists, and, in
the midst of the anxieties of the war in Spain, he composed
the <em>Anti-Cato</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>This moderation of Caesar has been justly praised: it is
not common with men who possess unlimited authority, and
the Romans justly said, that it is seldom a man is contented
to write when he can proscribe. The fact that he detested
Cato adds to the merit of his generous conduct. He always
speaks of him with bitterness in his <em>Commentaries</em>, and
although he was accustomed to do justice to his enemies,
he never misses an opportunity of decrying him. Has he
not dared to assert that in taking up arms against him, Cato
gave way to personal rancour and to the desire of revenging
his electoral defeats,<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c013'><sup>[304]</sup></a> when he well knew that no one had
more generously forgotten himself in order to think only of
his country! This was because there was more than political
disagreement between them, there was antipathy of character.
The defects of Cato must have been particularly disagreeable
to Caesar, and his virtues were those that Caesar not only
did not seek to acquire, but which he could not even understand.
How could he have any feeling for his strict respect
for law, for his almost servile attachment to old customs?
he who found a lively pleasure in laughing at ancient usages.
How could a prodigal, who had formed the habit of squandering
the money of the state and his own without reckoning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>how could he do justice to those rigorous scruples that Cato
had in the handling of the public funds, to the attention he
gave to his private affairs, and to that ambition, so strange
for that time, of not having more debts than assets? These
were, I repeat, qualities that Caesar could not comprehend.
He was, then, sincere and convinced when he attacked them.
A man of wit and pleasure, indifferent to principles, sceptical
in opinion, accustomed to live in a frivolous and polished
society, Cato could scarcely appear to him anything else than
fanatical and brutal. As there was nothing that he put
above refinement and politeness of manners, an elegant
vice suited him better than a savage virtue. Cato, on
the contrary, although he was not a stranger to literary
culture and the spirit of society, had none the less remained
at bottom an old-fashioned Roman. Notwithstanding their
power, society and letters could not entirely overcome
that bluntness, or if you will, that brutality of manner that
he owed to his constitution and his race, and of which
we find something even in his finest actions. To cite
only one example; Plutarch, in the admirable narrative
that he has given of his last moments, relates that, when
a slave refused, through affection for Cato, to give him his
sword, he knocked him down with a furious blow by which
his hand was covered with blood. To the eyes of a fastidious
man like Caesar, this blow revealed a vulgar nature, and I
am afraid prevented him understanding the grandeur of this
death. The same contrast, or rather the same antipathy, is
found in all their private conduct. While Caesar’s maxim was
to pardon everything in his friends, and he therefore pushed
complacency so far as to shut his eyes to their treasons,
Cato was too exacting and particular with regard to his. At
Cyprus he did not hesitate to fall out with Munatius, his
life-long companion, by showing an offensive distrust of him.
He was, no doubt, in his household, a model of honour and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>fidelity; yet he did not always maintain that respect and
regard for his wife that she deserved. We know how he
gave her up without ceremony to Hortensius, who had asked
him for her, to take her again without scruple after Hortensius’
death. How different was Caesar’s conduct with regard
to his, although he had reason to complain of her! A man
had been surprised at night in his house, the affair came
before the courts, he might have avenged the outrage,
but he preferred rather to forget it. Called as a witness
before the judges, he declared he knew nothing about it,
thus saving his rival in order to preserve his wife’s reputation.
He only divorced her later, when the report of the
intrigue had blown over. This was acting like a well-bred
man of the world. Here again, between Cato and him, it
is the least scrupulous and in the main the least honourable
of the two, the fickle and libertine husband, who, by reason of
a certain natural delicacy, appears in a more advantageous
light.</p>

<p class='c014'>This contrast in conduct, this opposition of character,
seem to me to explain the way in which Caesar writes of
Cato in his book, even better than all their political disagreements.
The fragments of it that survive and the
testimony of Plutarch, show that he attacked him with
extreme violence, and that he tried to make him at once
ridiculous and odious. But it was useless, it was lost labour.
People continued, notwithstanding his efforts, to read and
admire Cicero’s book. Not only did Cato’s reputation
survive Caesar’s insults, it increased still more under the
empire. In Nero’s time, when despotism was heaviest,
Thrasea wrote his history again, Seneca quotes him on every
page of his books, and to the end he was the pride and
model of honest men who preserved some feeling of honour
and dignity in the general abasement of character. They
studied his death even more than his life, for they needed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>then, above all, to learn how to die, and when this sad
necessity presented itself, it was his example they set before
their eyes, and his name that was in their mouths. To have
sustained and consoled so many noble hearts in these cruel
trials is assuredly a great glory, and I think that Cato would
not have desired any other.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>III.</h4>

<p class='c015'>The conclusion to be drawn from Caesar’s conduct after
Pharsalia, and from his relations with Cicero, is, that he
wished at that time to draw nearer to the republican party.
It was difficult for him to act otherwise. As long as it was
a question of overturning the republic, he had accepted the
support of everybody, and the worst men had come to him
by preference. “When a man was eaten up with debts and
in want of everything,” said Cicero, “and if, besides, he was
shown to be a scoundrel capable of daring anything, Caesar
made him his friend;”<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c013'><sup>[305]</sup></a> but all these unprincipled and
unscrupulous men, excellent for upsetting an established
power, were worth nothing in setting up a new one. It was
impossible that Caesar’s government should inspire any
confidence as long as some honourable persons, whom men
were accustomed to respect, were not seen with the master
and alongside these adventurers, whom they had learnt
to fear. Now, honourable men were chiefly found among
the vanquished. We must add that it was not Caesar’s
idea that one party alone should profit by his victory.
He had no ambition to work, like Marius or Sulla, for
the triumph of a faction: he wished to found a new
government, and he invited men of different opinions to
aid him in the enterprise. It has been asserted that he
sought to reconcile parties, and great compliments have
been paid him for it. The praise is not altogether just:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>he did not reconcile them, he annihilated them. In the
monarchical system, that he wished to establish,<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c013'><sup>[306]</sup></a> the old
parties of the republic had no place. He had cleverly used
the dissensions of the people and the senate to dominate
both; the first result of his victory was to put them both
aside, and we may say that after Pharsalia, there was only
Caesar on one side, and the vanquished on the other. This
explains how it was that, once victorious, he made use
indifferently of the partisans of the senate and those of the
democrats. This equality which he established between them
was natural, since they had all become, equally and without
distinction, his subjects. Only he well knew that in accepting
the services of the old republicans he should not have
instruments always tractable, and that he would be obliged
to allow them a certain independence of action and speech,
to preserve, at least outwardly, some appearance of a republic;
but that in itself did not give him much uneasiness.
He had not that invincible repugnance for liberty that princes
have who are born to an absolute throne, and who only
know its name to dread and detest it. He had lived with
it for twenty-three years, he had become accustomed to it,
he knew its importance. Therefore he did not seek to
destroy it entirely. He did not silence, as he might have
done, the eloquent voices that regretted the past; he did not
even impose silence on that harassing opposition that tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>to respond to his victories by jeers. He allowed some acts
of his administration to be criticized, and permitted men to
give him advice. This great mind well knew that a country
becomes enervated when the citizens are rendered indifferent
to public affairs, and lose the taste for attending to them.
He did not think that anything solid could be established
on passive and silent obedience, and in the government that
he founded he wished to preserve something of public life.
Cicero tells us this in a curious passage of his correspondence:
“We enjoy here a profound calm,” he writes to one
of his friends; “I should rather prefer, however, a little
honest and salutary agitation;” and he adds: “I see that
Caesar is of my opinion.”<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c013'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>All these reasons decided him to take one step further on
that path of generosity and clemency on which he had
entered after Pharsalia. He had pardoned the greater
number of those who had borne arms against him; he invited
some of them to share his power. At the very time that
he was recalling the greater part of the exiles, he appointed
Cassius his lieutenant; he gave Brutus the government of
Cisalpine Gaul, and Sulpicius that of Greece. We shall speak
further on of the first two; it is important, the better to
appreciate Caesar’s policy, to rapidly make known the third,
and to inquire how he had become worthy of the favours of
the conqueror, and in what manner he profited by them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Servius Sulpicius belonged to an important Roman family,
and was the most celebrated lawyer of his time. Cicero
gives him this great praise, namely, that he was the first to
bring philosophy into the law, that is to say, that he bound
together all those minute rules and precise formulas of
which this science is composed, by general principles and
comprehensive views.<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c013'><sup>[308]</sup></a> Accordingly he does not hesitate
to place him much above his predecessors, and more especially,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>over that great family of the Scaevolas, in which as it
seemed Roman jurisprudence had been up to that time
incarnate. There was, however, a difference between them
and Sulpicius, which it is important to notice: the Scaevolas
had given to Rome, lawyers, augurs, pontifs, that is to say,
they excelled in the arts that are friendly to tranquillity and
peace; but they were also very active citizens, resolute
politicians, valiant soldiers who courageously defended their
country against conspirators and against the foreigner.
They showed themselves, in their busy life, competent for
all affairs and equal to all situations. Scaevola the augur,
when Cicero knew him, was still, notwithstanding his age,
a vigorous old man, who rose at daybreak to meet his
country clients. He was the first to arrive at the Curia,
and he had always some book with him, that he read so as
not to remain idle while waiting for his colleagues; but
the day that Saturninus threatened the public tranquillity,
this learned man who loved study so much, this infirm old
man who supported himself with difficulty, and could only
use one arm, seized a javelin with that arm, and marched
at the head of the people to the assault of the Capitol.<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c013'><sup>[309]</sup></a>
Scaevola the pontif was not only an able lawyer, he was
also an upright administrator whose memory Asia never
forgot. When the farmers of the taxes attacked his quaestor
Rutilius, guilty of having wished to prevent them ruining
the province, he defended him with an admirable eloquence
and vigour that no threat could shake. He refused to leave
Rome at the time of the first proscriptions, and abandon
his clients and their business, although he knew the fate
that was awaiting him. Wounded at the funeral of Marius,
he was dispatched a few days later near the temple of
Vesta.<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c013'><sup>[310]</sup></a> However, such men were not exceptional at
Rome. In the best times of the republic, the complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>citizen had to be at once agriculturist, soldier, administrator,
financier, advocate, and even jurist. There were no specialists
then, and we should be forced to make now-a-days
four or five different persons out of one ancient Roman; but
in the period of which we are now speaking, these diverse
aptitudes that were then required in a single man were
separated: each man gave himself to a special science, and
we can begin to divide men of study from men of action. It
is difficult to say whether the reason of this was that men had
lost the energy of their character; or perhaps we should think
that since the masterpieces of Greece had been made known,
and each science had become more complicated, one man
could not any longer bear the burden of all united? However
this may be, if Sulpicius was above the Scaevolas as a
lawyer, he was far from having their firmness as a citizen.
Praetor or consul, he was never anything more than a man
of learning and chamber practice. In circumstances that
require resolution, every time it was necessary to decide and
to act, he was ill at ease. We feel that this honest and gentle
soul was not made to be the first magistrate of a republic
in a period of revolution. His fondness for always playing
the part of conciliator and arbitrator in that time of violence
ended by exciting laughter. Cicero himself, although he
was his friend, quizzes him a little, when he shows us this
great peacemaker starting off with his little secretary, after
having looked over all his lawyers’ rules, to intervene between
the parties at the time these parties only desired to
destroy one another.</p>

<p class='c014'>Caesar had always thought that Sulpicius was not of a
character to oppose him vigorously, and had early worked
to attach him to himself. He began by making an ally in
his house, and a powerful ally. It was a matter of common
talk at Rome, that the worthy Sulpicius allowed himself to
be led by his wife Postumia; Cicero, who likes to repeat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>scandals, several times tells us this. Now, Postumia’s
reputation was not spotless, and Suetonius places her name
on the list of those women who were loved by Caesar.
She is one of a very numerous company; but this fickle
man, who passed so quickly from one mistress to another,
had this singular privilege, that all the women whom he
abandoned, remained none the less his devoted friends.
They forgave his infidelities, they continued to take an
interest in all his successes, they put those immense resources
of ingenuity and persistency which belong only to
a woman who is in love, at the service of his policy. It
was no doubt Postumia who decided Sulpicius to work for
Caesar during the whole time that he was consul, and to
oppose the vehemence of his colleague Marcellus who wished
another governor of Gaul to be appointed. However, notwithstanding
all his weaknesses, Sulpicius was none the less
a sincere republican, and when the war had broken out, he
declared against Caesar, and left Italy. After the defeat,
he submitted like the rest, and he had resumed his usual
occupations, when Caesar sought him out in his retreat in
order to appoint him governor of Greece. It was certainly
impossible to find a government that suited him better. A
residence in Athens, at all times agreeable to the rich
Romans, must have been especially so at this time when
that city was the asylum of so many illustrious exiles.
Sulpicius could at the same time have the pleasure of hearing
the most celebrated rhetoricians and philosophers of
the world, and could talk of Rome and the republic with
eminent persons like Marcellus and Torquatus, and thus
satisfy all his tastes at once. Nothing could have been
more pleasing, we should have thought, to this scholar and
man of letters, whom chance had made a statesman, than the
exercise of extensive power, without danger, combined with
the most refined intellectual pleasures in one of the grandest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>and most beautiful countries in the world. We should,
therefore, have thought that Caesar had done the most
agreeable thing for him, in sending him on duty to that
city where the Romans usually went for pleasure. Yet it
does not seem that Sulpicius appreciated these advantages.
He had scarcely arrived in Greece, when he was discontented
at having gone, and longed to depart. Evidently it was
not the country that displeased him, he would not have
thought himself better off anywhere else; but he regretted
the republic. After having so timidly defended it, he could
not console himself for its fall, and blamed himself for
serving him who had overturned it. These feelings are
clearly expressed in a letter that he wrote to Cicero from
Greece. “Fortune,” he tells him, “has taken from us our
most precious possessions; we have lost our honour, our
dignity, and our country.... In the times in which we
live, those are most happy who are dead.”<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c013'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>When a timid and moderate man like Sulpicius dared
speak thus, what must others not have said and thought!
We can guess this when we see how Cicero writes to the
greater number of them. Although he is addressing officials
of the new government, he does not take the trouble to
hide his opinions; he freely expresses his regrets, because
he well knows they are shared by those to whom he is
writing. He speaks to Servilius Isauricus, the proconsul of
Asia, as to a man whom the absolute power of one does
not satisfy, and who wishes some restraints to be put on it.<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c013'><sup>[312]</sup></a>
He tells Cornificius, the governor of Africa, that affairs are
going ill at Rome, and that many things happen there
which would pain him.<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c013'><sup>[313]</sup></a> “I know what you think of the
lot of honest people, and of the misfortunes of the republic,”
he writes to Furfanius, the proconsul of Sicily, in recommending
an exile to him.<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c013'><sup>[314]</sup></a> These persons, however, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>accepted important offices from Caesar: they shared his
power, they passed for his friends; but all the favours they
had received from him had not thoroughly attached them
to his cause. They made their reservations while serving
him, and only half gave themselves up to him. Whence
could this opposition come, that the new government met
with among men who had at first agreed to take a share in
it? It proceeded from different motives which it is easy
to point out. The first, perhaps the most important, was
that this government, even while loading them with honours,
could not give them what the old republic would have
given them. With the establishment of the monarchy an
important change in all public employments was accomplished:
the magistrates became subordinate officials.
Formerly, those elected by the popular vote had the right
to act as they pleased within the sphere of their functions.
A fertile power of initiative inspired every rank of this
hierarchy of republican dignitaries. From the aedile to the
consul all were supreme within their own limits. They
could not be so under an absolute government. Instead of
governing on their own account, they were only the
channels, so to say, by which the will of a single man
acted to the ends of the earth. Certainly public security
gained much by the cessation of those conflicts of authorities,
which had continually troubled it, and it was a
great advantage for the provinces that absolute power had
been taken away from their greedy governors. Nevertheless,
if the governed profited by these reforms, it was natural
that the governors should be discontented with them. From
the moment that they were only entrusted with the execution
of the orders of another man the importance of their
functions diminished, and this sovereign and absolute
authority whose weight they always felt, finally vexed even
the most submissive. If ambitious men complained of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>diminution of their power, honest people did not get
accustomed so easily as might have been expected to the
loss of their liberty. In proportion as they left Pharsalia
behind, their regrets became more lively. They began to
get over the surprise of the defeat, and gradually recovered
from the fear it had caused them. During the moments
that immediately follow those great disasters in which men
have expected to perish, they give themselves up entirely to
the pleasure of living, but this pleasure is one of those to
which men accustom themselves so quickly, and which are
taken so much as a matter of course, that they soon cease
to be sensible of it. All those terrified people who on
the morrow of Pharsalia desired only tranquillity, when it
had been given them, wished for something else. As long
as men are uncertain of their life, they do not trouble
themselves to know if they shall live free, but when once
life is assured, the desire for liberty returns to all hearts, and
those who served Caesar felt it like the rest. Caesar, we
know, partly satisfied this desire, but this satisfaction did
not last long. It is as difficult to halt on the road to liberty
as on that to absolutism. One favour granted makes men
desire another, and men think less of enjoying what they
have obtained than of lamenting what they lack. It was
thus that Cicero, who had welcomed Caesar’s clemency
with transports of joy, and who saluted the return of
Marcellus as a sort of restoration of the republic, soon
changed his opinion and language. As we get on further
in his correspondence, he becomes more bitter and more
revolutionary. He who had so severely condemned those
who “after having disarmed their hands did not disarm
their hearts,”<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c013'><sup>[315]</sup></a> had his own heart filled with the bitterest
resentment. He said on every opportunity that all was
lost, that he blushed to be a slave, that he was ashamed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>live. He attacked with his pitiless raillery the most useful
measures and the most just acts. He laughed at the
reform of the calendar, and pretended to appear scandalized
at the enlargement of Rome. He went further. On the
day that the senate ordered Caesar’s statue to be placed
beside those of the ancient kings, he could not avoid making
a cruel allusion to the manner in which the first of these
kings had perished. “I am very glad,” said he, “to see
Caesar so near to Romulus!”<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c013'><sup>[316]</sup></a> And yet it was scarcely a
year since, in his speech for Marcellus, he had implored
him in the name of the country to watch over his life, and
had said with much feeling, “Your safety is ours!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Caesar, then, had only malcontents around him. The
moderate republicans, on whom he reckoned to aid him in
his work, could not resign themselves to the loss of the
republic. The exiles whom he had recalled to Rome were
more humiliated by his clemency than grateful for it, and
did not give up their resentment. His own generals, whom
he loaded with riches and honours, without being able to
satisfy their cupidity, reproached him for his ingratitude, and
even plotted his death. The common people, at last, of
whom he was the idol, and who had so cheerfully granted all
his demands, the people themselves began to withdraw from
him; they no longer welcomed his victories with the same
applause as formerly, and seemed to be afraid that they had
made him too great. When his statue was placed beside
those of the kings, the multitude, who saw it pass, remained
mute, and we know that the news of this unusual silence was
spread by the messengers of the allied kings and nations in
all the countries of the world, and caused it to be believed
everywhere that a revolution was at hand.<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c013'><sup>[317]</sup></a> In the provinces
of the East, where the last soldiers of Pompey were hiding,
the fire of civil war, which was smouldering rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>extinct, constantly revived, and these perpetual alarms,
without leading to serious danger, prevented the public
tranquillity becoming settled. At Rome, Cicero’s works, in
which he celebrated the glories of the republic, were read
with enthusiasm; anonymous pamphlets, which had never
been more violent or more numerous, were eagerly sought.
As happens on the eve of great crises, every one was discontented
with the present, unquiet about the future, and
prepared for the unforeseen. We know in how tragical a
manner this strained situation terminated. The stab of
Brutus’ dagger was not altogether, as has been said, an unpremeditated
incident and a chance; it was the general
uneasiness of men’s minds which led to and which explains
such a terrible catastrophe. The conspirators were but
little over sixty in number, but they had all Rome for their
accomplice.<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c013'><sup>[318]</sup></a> All this disquietude and rancour, those bitter
regrets for the past, those disappointed ambitions, this
baffled cupidity, this open or secret hatred, those bad or
generous passions of which men’s hearts were full, armed
their hands, and the Ides of March were only the deadly
explosion of so much stored-up anger. Thus events frustrated
all Caesar’s projects. He did not find safety in his
clemency, as he thought; he failed in that work of conciliation
that he had attempted with the applause of the world:
he did not succeed in disarming parties. This glory was
reserved for a man who had neither his breadth of genius,
nor his generosity of character—for the crafty and cruel
Octavius. This is not the only time that history shows us
the sad spectacle of the success of ordinary men where the
greatest have failed; but in enterprises of this nature success
depends above all on circumstances, and it must be admitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>that they singularly favoured Augustus. Tacitus tells us
the principal cause of his good fortune, when he says,
speaking of the establishment of the empire: “There was
almost no one left who had seen the republic.”<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c013'><sup>[319]</sup></a> The men
over whom Caesar aspired to reign, on the contrary, had all
seen it. Many cursed it when it troubled the tranquillity
of their lives by its storms and agitations; almost all regretted
it as soon as they had lost it. There is, notwithstanding
the perils to which it exposes men, a singular
charm and attraction in the habit and exercise of liberty
which cannot be forgotten when once it has been known.
It was against this inextinguishable memory that the genius
of Caesar was shattered. But after the battle of Actium,
the men who had looked upon the grand scenes of liberty,
and who had seen the republic, no longer existed. A civil
war of twenty years, the most murderous of all those that
have ever depopulated the world, had destroyed them
almost all. The recollections of the new generation did
not go further back than Caesar. The first sounds it had
heard were the acclamations that saluted the conqueror of
Pharsalia, of Thapsus, and of Munda; the first spectacle
that had struck its eyes was that of the proscriptions. It
had grown up among pillage and massacres. During twenty
years it had daily trembled for its property or its life. It
thirsted for security, and was ready to sacrifice everything
for repose. Nothing attracted it towards the past, as the
contemporaries of Caesar had been attracted. On the contrary,
all the memories of the past which survived only
attached it more to the government under which it lived,
and when by chance it turned its eyes backwards it found
many subjects for fear without any subject for regret.
It was only under these circumstances that absolute power
could peaceably succeed the republic.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c011'>HIS RELATIONS WITH CICERO</h3>

<p class='c015'>We should not know Brutus without Cicero’s letters. As
he has never been spoken of with composure, and as
political parties have been accustomed to screen their
hatred or their hopes under his name, the true features of
his character were early effaced. Amid the heated discussions
that his mere name raises, while some, like Lucan,
exalt him almost to heaven, and others, like Dante, resolutely
place him in hell, it was not long before he became
a sort of legendary personage. To read Cicero brings us
back to the reality. Thanks to him, this striking but
indistinct figure, that admiration or terror have immoderately
enlarged, becomes more defined and takes human proportions.
If it loses in grandeur by being viewed so close,
at least it gains something by becoming true and living.</p>

<p class='c014'>The connection between Cicero and Brutus lasted ten
years. The collection of letters they wrote to each other
during this interval must have been voluminous, since a
grammarian quotes the ninth book of them. They are all
lost, with the exception of twenty-five which were written
after the death of Caesar.<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c013'><sup>[320]</sup></a> Notwithstanding the loss of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>rest, Brutus still holds such a large place in the surviving
works of Cicero, and especially in his correspondence, that
we find in it all the elements necessary for becoming well
acquainted with him. I am going to collect these references,
and to re-write, not the narrative of Brutus’ entire life,
which would oblige me to dwell upon very well-known
events, but only the history of his relations with Cicero.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>I.</h4>

<p class='c015'>Atticus, the friend of everybody, brought them together.
It was about the year 700, a short time after Cicero’s return
from exile, and in the midst of the troubles stirred up by
Clodius, one of those vulgar agitators like Catiline, by whose
means Caesar exhausted the strength of the Roman
aristocracy that he might one day overcome it more easily.
Cicero and Brutus occupied at that time very different
positions in the republic. Cicero had filled the highest
offices, and in them had rendered eminent services. His
talents and his probity made him a valuable auxiliary
for the aristocratical party to which he was attached; he
was not without influence with the people whom his
eloquence charmed; the provinces loved him, as they
had seen him more than once defend their interests
against greedy governors, and still more recently Italy had
shown her affection by carrying him in triumph from
Brundusium to Rome. Brutus was only thirty-one; a great
part of his life had been passed away from Rome, at Athens,
where we know that he devoted himself earnestly to the
study of Greek philosophy, in Cyprus, and in the East,
where he had followed Cato. He had not yet filled any
of those offices which gave political importance, and he had
to wait more than ten years before thinking of the consulship.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Nevertheless Brutus was already an important person.
In his early relations with Cicero, notwithstanding the
distance that age and official position set between them,
it is Cicero who makes the advances, who treats Brutus
with consideration, and who seeks his friendship. One
would say that this young man had given rise to singular
expectations, and that it was already vaguely felt that he
was destined for great things. While Cicero was in Cilicia,
Atticus, pressing him to do justice to certain claims of
Brutus, said: “It would be something if you only brought
back his friendship from that province.”<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c013'><sup>[321]</sup></a> And Cicero
wrote of him at the same period: “He is already the first
among the young men; he will soon be, I hope, the first in
the city.”<a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c013'><sup>[322]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Everything in fact seemed to promise a splendid future
for Brutus. A descendant of one of the most illustrious
families of Rome, the nephew of Cato, the brother-in-law of
Cassius and Lepidus, he had just married one of the
daughters of Appius Claudius; another was already married
to Pompey’s eldest son. By these alliances he was connected
on all sides with the most influential families; but his
character and manners distinguished him even more than
his birth. His youth had been austere: he had studied
philosophy, not merely as a <i><span lang="it">dilettante</span></i> and as being a most
useful discipline for the mind, but like a wise man who
wishes to apply the lessons that it gives. He had returned
from Athens with a great reputation for wisdom, which his
virtuous and regular life confirmed. The admiration that
his virtue excited was redoubled when his surroundings and
the detestable examples he had resisted were considered.
His mother Servilia had been the object of one of the most
violent passions of Caesar, perhaps his first love. She
always held a great sway over him, and took advantage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>it to enrich herself after Pharsalia by getting the property
of the conquered awarded to her. When she became old,
and felt the powerful dictator slipping from her, in order to
continue to rule him, she favoured, it is said, his amours
with one of her daughters, the wife of Cassius. The
daughter who had married Lepidus, had no better reputation,
and Cicero tells a merry tale about her. A young
Roman fop, C. Vedius, going through Cilicia with a great
train, found it convenient to leave part of his baggage with
one of his hosts. Unfortunately this host died; seals were
put on the traveller’s baggage along with the rest, and to
begin with, the portraits of five great ladies were found in
it, and among them that of Brutus’ sister. “It must be
admitted,” said Cicero, who did not lose an opportunity for
a joke, “that the brother and the husband well deserve their
names. The brother is very stupid (<i><span lang="la">brutus</span></i>) who perceives
nothing, and the husband very easy-going (<i><span lang="la">lepidus</span></i>) who
endures all without complaint.”<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c013'><sup>[323]</sup></a> Such was the family of
Brutus. As to his friends, there is no need to say much
about them. We know how the rich young men of Rome
lived at that time, and what Caelius, Curio, and Dolabella
were. Among all this dissipation the rigid integrity of
Brutus, his application to business, that disdain for pleasures,
that taste for study to which his pale and serious countenance
bore witness, stood out in higher relief by the contrast.
Accordingly all eyes were fixed on this grave young man
who resembled the others so little. In approaching him
men could not help a feeling that seemed ill suited to his
age: he inspired respect. Even those who were his elders
and his superiors, Cicero and Caesar, notwithstanding their
glory, Antony who resembled him so little, his opponents
and his enemies, could not escape this impression in his
presence. What is most surprising is, that it has survived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>him. It has been felt in presence of his memory as it was
before his person; living and dead he has commanded
respect. The official historians of the empire, Dio, who
has so roughly handled Cicero, Velleius, the flatterer of
Tiberius, all have respected Brutus. It seems that political
rancour, the wish to flatter, and the violence of party have
felt themselves disarmed before this austere figure.</p>

<p class='c014'>While respecting him, they loved him. These are sentiments
which do not always go together. Aristotle forbids
us to represent heroes perfect in all points in the drama, lest
they should not interest the public. Things go in ordinary
life very much as they do on the stage; a sort of instinctive
dread holds us aloof from irreproachable characters, and as
it is usually by our common failings that we are drawn
together, we feel very little attraction towards a man who
has no failings, and are content to respect perfection at a
distance. Yet it was not so in the case of Brutus, and
Cicero could say of him with truth in one of the works that
he addresses to him: “Who was ever more respected and
loved than you?”<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c013'><sup>[324]</sup></a> And yet this man without weaknesses
was weak for those he loved. His mother and sisters had
great influence over him, and made him commit more than
one fault. He had many friends, and Cicero blames him
for listening too readily to their advice; they were worthy
men who understood nothing of public affairs; but Brutus
was so much attached to them that he could not protect
himself against them. His last sorrow at Philippi was to
learn of the death of Flavius, his overseer of works, and
that of Labeo, his lieutenant; he forgot his own self to
weep for them. His last words before his death were to
congratulate himself that none of his friends had betrayed
him: this fidelity, so rare at that time, consoled his last
moments. His legions also, although they were partly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>composed of old soldiers of Caesar, and he kept them
tightly in hand, punishing plunderers and marauders, his very
legions loved him and remained faithful to him. Even the
people of Rome themselves, who were in general enemies
of the cause he defended, showed their sympathy for him
more than once. When Octavius proclaimed the assassins
of Caesar public enemies, every one sadly bowed their
heads when they heard the name of Brutus pronounced
from the rostrum, and in the midst of the terrified senate
which foresaw the proscriptions, a voice dared to declare
that it would never condemn Brutus.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero fell under the charm like the rest, but not without
resistance. His friendship with Brutus was troubled and
stormy, and, notwithstanding the general agreement of their
opinions, violent dissensions arose between them more than
once. Their disagreements are explained by the diversity
of their characters. Never did two friends resemble each
other less. There never was a man who seemed made for
society more than Cicero; he brought into it all the qualities
that are necessary for success, great flexibility of opinion,
much toleration for others, allowance enough for himself,
the talent of steering with ease between all parties, and a
certain natural indulgence that made him understand and
almost accept everything. Although he made bad verses,
he had the temperament of a poet, a strange mobility of
impression, an irritable sensitiveness, a supple, broad, and
quick intellect which conceived promptly, but quickly
abandoned its ideas, and passed from one extreme to
another at a bound. He did not make a single serious
resolution of which he did not repent the next day. Whenever
he joined a party he was only quick and decided at
the beginning, and gradually cooled down. Brutus, on the
contrary, had not a quick intelligence: he usually hesitated
at the commencement of an enterprise and did not decide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>at once. Slow and serious, he advanced step by step in
everything, but, once resolved, he was so absorbed in his
conviction that nothing could divert him: he isolated and
concentrated himself in it, he excited and inflamed himself
for it by reflection, and at last listened only to that inflexible
logic that drove him to realize his purpose. He was one of
those minds of which Saint-Simon says that they have an
almost ferocious consistency. His obstinacy was the real
source of his strength, and Caesar well understood it when
he said of him: “All that he wills he means.”<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c013'><sup>[325]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Two friends who resembled each other so little must
naturally have clashed at every opportunity. Their first
differences were literary. It was a custom then at the bar
to divide an important case among several orators; each
took the part best suited to his talents. Cicero, obliged
to appear often before the judges, went with his friends and
pupils, and gave out to them part of his work in order to
be able to get through it. He was often satisfied with
keeping the peroration for himself, in which his copious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>and impassioned eloquence was at home, and left them
the rest. It was thus that Brutus pleaded at his side and
under his direction. Brutus, however, was not of his
school: a fanatical admirer of Demosthenes, whose statue
he had placed among those of his ancestors, and nurtured
on the study of the Attic masters, he sought to reproduce
their graceful severity and vigorous strength. Tacitus says
that his efforts were not always happy: by dint of avoiding
ornament and pathos he was dull and cold, and by too
eagerly seeking precision and strength he became dry and
stiff. These faults were repugnant to Cicero, who always
saw in this type of eloquence, which was founding a school,
a criticism of his own, and tried by every means to convert
Brutus; but he did not succeed, and on this point they
never agreed. After the death of Caesar, and when something
else than literary discussions was in question, Brutus
sent his friend the speech he had just delivered in the
Capitol, and begged him to correct it. Cicero took good
care not to do so: he knew too well by experience the
self-esteem of the literary man to run the risk of offending
Brutus by trying to do better than he. Besides, the speech
seemed to him very fine, and he wrote to Atticus that
nothing could have been more graceful or better written.
“Yet,” added he, “if I had had to make it I should have
put more passion in it.”<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c013'><sup>[326]</sup></a> Assuredly Brutus did not lack
passion, but it was in him a secret and repressed flame that
only touched the nearest, and he disliked to give the rein
to those powerful emotions and that fiery pathos without
which one cannot carry away the multitude.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was not then a docile follower of Cicero, and we may
add that neither was he an accommodating friend. He
lacked pliancy in his relations with others, and his tone
was always rough and abrupt. At the commencement of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>their intercourse, Cicero, accustomed to be treated with
great respect even by the highest personages, thought the
letters of this young man were curt and haughty, and felt
hurt. This was not the only complaint he had to make
of him. We know the great consular’s irritable, suspicious
and exacting vanity; we know to what a degree he loved
praise; he gave it to himself liberally and he expected it
from others, and if they were slow in giving it he was not
ashamed to ask for it. His friends were generally indulgent
to this harmless failing, and did not wait to be invited by
him to praise him. Brutus alone resisted; he prided himself
on his candour, and spoke out what he thought.
Accordingly Cicero often complains that he was chary of his
praises; one day indeed he was seriously angry with him.
It was a question of the great consulship, and of the discussion
in consequence of which Lentulus and the accomplices
of Catiline were executed. This was the most
vigorous action of Cicero’s life, and he had a right to be
proud of it, since he had paid for it with exile. In the
narrative that Brutus gave of the events of this day he
depreciated the part that Cicero had played in them to the
advantage of his uncle Cato. He only praised him for
having punished the conspiracy, without saying that he had
discovered it, and contented himself with calling him an
<em>excellent consul</em>. “Poor praise!” said Cicero angrily; “one
would think it came from an enemy.”<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c013'><sup>[327]</sup></a> But those were
only small differences arising from wounded self-esteem,
which might easily be made up; we must now mention a
graver disagreement that deserves to be dwelt upon, for it
suggests some serious reflections on the Roman society of
that period.</p>

<p class='c014'>In 702, that is to say, a short time after the commencement
of his relations with Brutus, Cicero went out as proconsul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>to Cilicia. He had not sought this office, for he
knew what difficulties he should find in it. He set out
decided to do his duty, and he could not do it without
bringing on his hands at the same time the patricians, his
protectors, and the knights, his <i><span lang="fr">protégés</span></i> and clients. In
fact, patricians and knights, usually enemies, agreed, with
a singular unanimity, in plundering the provinces. The
knights, farmers of the public revenue, had only one
thought: to make a fortune in five years, the usual duration
of their contract. Consequently they exacted without mercy
the tax of a tenth on the productions of the soil, a twentieth
on merchandise at the ports, the harbour dues, the tax on
pasture-lands in the interior; in fact, all the tribute that
Rome had imposed on the conquered nations. Their
greed respected nothing. Livy wrote this terrible sentence
about them: “Wherever the ‘publican’ penetrates, there
is no more justice or liberty for any one.”<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c013'><sup>[328]</sup></a> It was very
difficult for the wretched cities to satisfy these insatiable
financiers; almost everywhere the municipal coffers, ill
administered by incompetent, or pillaged by dishonest
magistrates, were empty. Money, however, had to be
found at any price. Now, of whom could they borrow
it, except of the bankers of Rome, who had been for a
century the bankers of the whole world? It was to them
therefore that they applied. Some were rich enough to
draw from their private fortune money to lend to foreign
cities, or sovereigns, like that Rabirius Postumus, for whom
Cicero had pleaded, who furnished the king of Egypt
with the money necessary to reconquer his kingdom.
Others, in order to run less risk, formed financial companies,
in which the most illustrious Romans invested their funds.
Thus, Pompey had a share for a considerable sum in one
of those joint-stock companies founded by Cluvius of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Puteoli. All these money-lenders, whether private individuals
or companies, knights or patricians, were very unscrupulous,
and only advanced their money at enormous
interest, generally 4 or 5 per cent. per month. Their
difficulty consisted in getting paid. As it is only men who
are quite ruined who accept these hard terms, the money
lent on such high interest is always subject to risk. When
the date of payment arrived the poor city was less than ever
in a position to pay: it employed a thousand pettifogging
tricks, spoke of complaining to the senate, and began by
appealing to the proconsul. Unfortunately for it, the proconsul
was usually an accomplice of its enemies, and took
his share of their profits. The creditors who had secured
his co-operation by paying him well, had then only to send
into the province some freedman or agent who represented
them; the proconsul placed the public forces at the service
of private interests, gave this agent the title of his lieutenant,
some soldiers, and full powers, and if the insolvent town
did not quickly come to some satisfactory arrangement, it
suffered the horrors of a siege and of official pillage in time
of peace. The proconsul who refused to lend himself to
these abuses, and who intended, according to Cicero’s
expression, to prevent the provinces perishing, naturally
aroused the anger of all those who lived by the ruin of the
provinces. The knights, the nobles, who no longer got
their money, became his deadly enemies. It is true he
had the gratitude of his province, but this did not amount
to much. It had been remarked that, in those Eastern
countries “trained by a long servitude to loathsome
flattery,”<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c013'><sup>[329]</sup></a> the governors who received most adulation, and
to whom they raised most statues were precisely those who
had robbed the most, because they were the most dreaded.
Cicero’s predecessor had completely ruined Cilicia: consequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>they thought of building him a temple. These
were some of the difficulties to which an upright governor
exposed himself. Cicero extricated himself with honour.
Seldom was a province so well administered as his under
the Roman republic; but he only brought back from it
some gratitude, little money, and many enemies, and very
nearly quarrelled with Brutus.</p>

<p class='c014'>Brutus, though we can scarcely believe it, had a hand in
this traffic. He had lent money to Ariobarzanes, king of
Armenia, one of those small princes that Rome charitably
allowed to live, and to the town of Salamis in the island
of Cyprus. At the moment of Cicero’s departure for his
province, Atticus, who himself, as we know, did not despise
this species of gain, recommended these two affairs to him
very warmly; but Brutus had invested his money badly,
and it was not possible for Cicero to get him repaid.
Ariobarzanes had many creditors and paid none. “I cannot
imagine,” said Cicero, “any one poorer than this king,
and anything more miserable than this kingdom.”<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c013'><sup>[330]</sup></a> Nothing
could be got from him. As to the business of
Salamis, it was from the first still graver. Brutus had not
dared, at the beginning, to acknowledge that he was directly
interested in it, the usury was so enormous and the circumstances
so scandalous. A certain Scaptius, a friend of
Brutus, had lent a large sum to the inhabitants of Salamis
at 4 per cent. per month. As they could not repay it he
had, according to custom, obtained from Appius, Cicero’s
predecessor, a company of cavalry, with which he held the
senate of Salamis so closely besieged that five senators had
died of hunger. On learning of this conduct Cicero was
shocked, and hastened to recall the soldiers of whom such
bad use had been made. He only thought he was hurting
a <i><span lang="fr">protégé</span></i> of Brutus; but as the affair took a more serious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>turn, Brutus showed his hand more openly, so that Cicero
might show himself more accommodating in arranging
matters. As he saw that he had no hope of being paid,
except at a great reduction, he became quite offended, and
decided to let it be known that Scaptius was only a man
of straw, and that he himself was the real creditor of the
Salaminians. Cicero’s astonishment when he learnt this
will be shared by everybody, so much does Brutus’ action
seem at variance with his whole conduct. Certainly no one
could doubt his disinterestedness and honesty. Some years
before, Cato had paid them a splendid tribute, when, not
knowing whom to trust, so rare were men of honour, he had
appointed him to collect the treasure of the king of Cyprus,
and to carry it to Rome. Let us be assured then, that if
Brutus conducted himself as he had done towards the Salaminians,
it was because he thought he might legitimately do so.
He followed the example of others, he yielded to an opinion
that was universal around him. The provinces were still
considered as conquered countries by the Romans of that
time. They had been conquered too short a time for the
remembrance of their defeat to be obliterated. It was
supposed that they also had not forgotten it, which led to
distrust of them; in any case it was remembered, and the
conquerors always thought themselves armed with those
terrible laws of war against which no one in antiquity had
protested. The property of the vanquished belonging to
the victor, far from blaming themselves for taking what
they took, they thought they gave whatever they did not
take, and perhaps at the bottom of their heart they thought
they were generous in leaving them anything. The provinces
were regarded as the domains and property of the
Roman people (<i><span lang="la">praedia, agri fructuarii populi Romani</span></i>), and
they were treated accordingly. When they consented to
spare them it was not through pity or affection, but through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>prudence, and in imitation of good landowners who take
care not to exhaust their fields by over-cultivation. This was
the meaning of the laws made under the republic to protect
the provinces; humanity had a smaller share in them than
well-considered interest, which, in exercising a certain restraint
on the present, is mindful of the future. Evidently
Brutus fully accepted this way of looking at the rights of the
conqueror and the condition of the vanquished. In this
we touch one of the greatest failings of this upright but
narrow soul. Brought up in the selfish ideas of the Roman
aristocracy, he had not sufficient breadth or elevation of
mind to perceive their iniquity; he followed them without
hesitation till the time that his natural mildness and
humanity got the better of the recollections of his education,
and the traditions of his class. The mode in which he
behaved in the provinces that he governed shows that all his
life there was a struggle between the integrity of his nature
and these imperious prejudices. After having ruined the
Salaminians by his usury, he governed Cisalpine Gaul with
a disinterestedness that did him honour, and while he had
made himself detested in the island of Cyprus, the remembrance
of his beneficent administration was preserved in
Milan even to the time of Augustus. The same contrast
is found in the last campaign; he wept with grief at seeing
the inhabitants of Xanthus persist in destroying their city,
and on the eve of Philippi he promised his soldiers the
pillage of Thessalonica and Lacedaemon. This is the
single grave fault that Plutarch finds to censure in his
whole life; it was the last awakening of an inveterate
prejudice of which he could never get rid notwithstanding
his uprightness of mind, and which shows the sway that
the society in which his birth had placed him, exercised
over him to the last.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet this influence was not felt then by everybody. Cicero,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>who, being a “new man,” could more easily protect himself
against the tyranny of tradition, had always shown more
humanity towards the provinces, and blamed the scandalous
gains that were drawn from them. In a letter to his
brother he boldly proclaimed this principle,<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c013'><sup>[331]</sup></a> then altogether
new, that they must not be governed in the exclusive interest
of the Roman people, but also in their own interest, and in
such a manner as to give them the greatest amount of
happiness and well-being that was possible. This is what
he tried to do in Cilicia: accordingly he was very much hurt
by the action of Brutus, and flatly refused to have anything
to do with it, although Atticus, whose conscience was more
elastic, warmly begged him to do so. “I am sorry,” he
replied, “that I am not able to please Brutus, and still more
so to find him so different from what I had thought him.”<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c013'><sup>[332]</sup></a>
“If he condemns me,” he said elsewhere, “I do not want
such friends. At least I am certain that his uncle Cato will
not condemn me.”<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c013'><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>These were bitter words, and their friendship would no
doubt have suffered much from these disputes if the grave
events which supervened had not drawn them together again.
Cicero had scarcely returned to Italy when the civil war, so
long foreseen, broke out. Private differences had to disappear
before this great conflict. Besides, Cicero and Brutus were
united by a singular community of feelings. Both had gone
to Pompey’s camp, but both had done so without enthusiasm
or eagerness, as a sacrifice demanded by duty. Brutus
loved Caesar, who showed him a paternal affection on all
occasions, and moreover he detested Pompey. Besides the
fact that his pompous vanity displeased him, he could not
forgive the death of his father, killed during the civil wars of
Sulla. Yet, in this public danger, he forgot his personal
likings and hatreds, and went to Thessaly, where the consuls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>and senate were already. We know that he made himself
remarked for his zeal in Pompey’s camp;<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c013'><sup>[334]</sup></a> many things however
happened there which must have displeased him, and
no doubt he thought that too many personal rancours and
ambitions were mixed up with the cause of liberty which
alone he wished to defend. This also displeased his friend
Cicero and his brother-in-law Cassius, and these two last,
indignant at the language of those madmen who surrounded
Pompey, resolved not to pursue the war to extremes as others
wished to do. “I still remember,” Cicero wrote later to
Cassius, “those familiar conversations in which, after long
deliberation, we made up our minds to allow our action, if
not the abstract justice of our cause, to be determined by the
result of a single battle.”<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c013'><sup>[335]</sup></a> We do not know whether Brutus
was present at these conversations of his two friends; but it
is certain that all three behaved in the same manner. Cicero,
on the day after Pharsalia, refused the command of the
republican army; Cassius hastened to hand over the fleet he
commanded to Caesar; as to Brutus, he did his duty as a
brave man during the battle; but, the battle over, he thought
he had done enough, and went over to the conqueror, who
welcomed him joyfully, took him apart in confidential conversation,
and succeeded in obtaining some information
about Pompey’s retreat. After this conversation Brutus was
completely gained over; not only did he not go and rejoin
the republicans who were fighting in Africa, but he followed
Caesar to the conquest of Egypt and of Asia.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>II.</h4>

<p class='c015'>Brutus was thirty-seven years old at the battle of Pharsalia.
This was the age of political activity among the Romans.
Usually a man had then just been quaestor or aedile; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>might look forward to the praetorship and the consulship, and
acquired a right to gain them by courageously contending in
the Forum or the Curia. The brightest hope of every young
man on entering public life was to obtain these high
honours at the age appointed by law, the praetorship at
forty and the consulship at forty-three, and nothing
was thought to give greater distinction than to be able
to say, “I was praetor or consul as soon as I had the right
to be so (<i><span lang="la">meo anno</span></i>).” If by good luck, while a man held
these offices, fortune favoured him by some considerable war
that gave an opportunity of killing five thousand enemies, he
obtained a triumph and had nothing more to wish for.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is no doubt that Brutus had conceived this hope
like the rest, and it is certain that his birth and his talents
would have permitted him to realize it; Pharsalia upset all
these projects. He was not precluded from honours, for he
was the friend of him who distributed them; but these
honours were now only empty titles, since one man had
seized all real power. This man really aimed at being
sole master, and admitted no one to share his authority.
“He does not even consult his own friends,” says Cicero,
“and only takes counsel of himself.”<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c013'><sup>[336]</sup></a> Political life did not
exist for the rest, and even those whom the new government
employed felt time hang heavy on their hands, especially
after the violent agitations of the preceding years. God,
according to Virgil’s expression, gave leisure to everybody.
Brutus employed this leisure by returning to the studies of
his youth, which he had rather interrupted than forsaken.
To return to them was to draw still nearer to Cicero.</p>

<p class='c014'>He had not indeed forgotten him; while following Caesar
in Asia he had learnt that his friend, having retired to
Brundusium, suffered at once from the threats of the
Caesarians, who did not forgive his going to Pharsalia, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>from the ill-will of the Pompeians, who blamed him for having
returned too quickly. Amidst all this irritation, Cicero,
who, as we know, had not much energy, was very downcast.
Brutus wrote to him to encourage him. “You have performed
actions,” said he, “which will speak of you, notwithstanding
your silence, which will live after your death, and which, by
the safety of the state, if the state is saved, by its loss,
if it is not saved, will for ever bear witness in favour of
your political conduct.”<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c013'><sup>[337]</sup></a> Cicero says that in reading this
letter he seemed to recover from a long illness, and to
open his eyes to the light. When Brutus returned to Rome,
their intercourse became more frequent. Knowing each other
better they appreciated each other more. Cicero, whose
imagination was so lively, whose heart was so youthful, in
spite of his sixty years, became entirely enamoured of
Brutus. This constant communication with a mind so
inquiring and a soul so upright, reanimated and revived his
talents. His friend always holds a large place in the fine
works that he published at that time, which succeeded each
other so rapidly. We see that his heart is full of him, he
speaks of him as often as he can, he is never weary of praising
him, he wishes to please him before everything; one
would almost say that he cares only for the praises and
friendship of Brutus.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was the study of philosophy that united them above all.
Both loved and cultivated it from their youth, both seemed
to love it more and to cultivate it more ardently when the
concentration of the government in one hand had removed
them from public life. Cicero, who could not accustom
himself to repose, turned all his activity towards it. “Greece
is getting old,” he said to his pupils and friends, “let us
snatch from her her philosophical glory;”<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c013'><sup>[338]</sup></a> and he at once
set about the work. He groped about for some time, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>did not immediately hit upon the philosophy that was suitable
to his fellow-countrymen. He had been tempted for a
moment to direct their attention towards those subtle metaphysical
questions that were repugnant to the practical good
sense of the Romans. He had translated the <em>Timaeus</em>, that
is to say, the most obscure thing in Plato’s philosophy; but
he quickly perceived that he was mistaken, and hastened to
quit that path in which he would have walked alone. In
the Tusculan Disputations he returned to questions of applied
morality and did not leave them again. The diverse
characters of the passions, the real nature of virtue, the
relative rank of duties, all those problems that a virtuous
man proposes to himself during his life; above all, that before
which he so often draws back, but which always returns with
a terrible persistency and troubles at times the most gross
and earthly souls, the future after death; this is what he
studies without tricks of dialectical skill, without the prejudices
of a school, without a preconceived system, and with
less anxiety to discover new ideas than to accept practical
and sensible principles wherever he found them. Such is the
character of Roman philosophy, of which we must be careful
not to speak ill, for it has played a great part in the
world, and it is through it that the wisdom of the Greeks,
rendered at once more solid and yet more clear, has come
down to the nations of the West. This philosophy dates
from Pharsalia, like the empire, and owes much to the
victory of Caesar, who, by suppressing political life, forced
inquiring minds to seek other subjects for their activity.
Welcomed at first, with enthusiasm, by all minds unoccupied
and ill at ease, it became more and more popular in proportion
as the authority of the emperors became more oppressive.
To the absolute authority that the government exercised
over external actions they were glad to oppose the entire
self-possession that philosophy gives; to study oneself, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>withdraw into oneself was to escape on one side from the
tyranny of the master, and in seeking to know oneself the
ground to which his power had no access seemed to be
enlarged. The emperors understood this well; and were
the mortal enemies of a science that was so bold as to limit
their authority. Along with history, which recalled disagreeable
memories, it soon fell under their suspicion;
they were two names, said Tacitus, unpleasing to princes,
<i><span lang="la">ingrata principibus nomina</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have not here to show why all the philosophical works
composed at the end of the republic or under the empire have
a much greater importance than the books we write now on
the same subjects: this has been too well told already for me
to have need to return to it.<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c013'><sup>[339]</sup></a> It is certain that during that
time when religion was confined to ritual, when its books
only contained collections of formulae and the minute
regulations of observances, and when it did not go beyond
teaching its adepts the science of sacrificing according to the
rites, philosophy alone could give to all virtuous and troubled
souls which were tossed about without definite aim and were
desirous of finding one, that teaching of which they had
need. We must not forget, then, when we read an ethical
treatise of that time, that it was written not only for lettered
idlers who are delighted with fine discourses, but for those
whom Lucretius represents as groping after the way of life;
we must remind ourselves that these precepts have been
practised, that theories became rules of conduct, and that,
so to say, all this ethical theory was once alive. Let us
take for example the first Tusculan Disputation: Cicero
wishes to prove in it that death is not an evil. What a trite
remark in appearance, and how difficult it is not to regard all
this elaborated treatment as an oratorical exercise and an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>essay for the schools! It is nothing of the kind however,
and the generation for whom it was written found something
else in it. Men read it on the eve of the proscriptions to
renew their strength, and came from their reading firmer,
more resolute, better prepared to support the great misfortunes
that they foresaw. Atticus himself, the egotist
Atticus, so far removed from risking his life for anybody,
found in them the source of an unusual energy. “You
tell me,” Cicero writes to him, “that my Tusculans give you
courage: so much the better. There is no surer and speedier
resource against circumstances than that which I indicate.”<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c013'><sup>[340]</sup></a>
This resource was death. How many people accordingly
availed themselves of it! Never has a more incredible
contempt of life been seen, never has death caused less fear.
Since Cato, suicide became a contagion, a frenzy. The
vanquished, Juba, Petreius, Scipio, know no other way
of escaping the conqueror. Laterensis kills himself through
regret when he sees his friend Lepidus betray the republic;
Scapula, who can no longer hold out in Cordova, has a
funeral pyre constructed, and burns himself alive; when
Decimus Brutus, a fugitive, hesitates to choose this heroic
remedy, his friend Blasius kills himself before him in order
to set him an example. It was a veritable delirium at
Philippi. Even those who might have escaped did not seek
to survive their defeat. Quintilius Varus put on the insignia
of his rank, and had himself killed by a slave; Labeo dug his
own grave and killed himself on its brink; Cato the younger,
for fear of being spared, threw away his helmet and shouted
his name; Cassius was impatient, and killed himself too
soon; Brutus closes the list by a suicide, astonishing by its
calmness and dignity. What a strange and frightful commentary
on the Tusculans, and how clearly this general truth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>thus put in practice by so many men of spirit, ceases to
be a mere platitude!</p>

<p class='c014'>We must study in the same spirit the very short fragments
that remain of the philosophical works of Brutus.
The general thoughts that we find in them will no longer
appear insignificant and vague when we think that he who
formulated them also intended to put them in practice in
his life. The most celebrated of all these writings of
Brutus, the treatise <cite>On Virtue</cite>, was addressed to Cicero, and
is worthy of them both. It was a fine work that was especially
pleasing because it was felt that the writer was thoroughly
convinced of all that he said.<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c013'><sup>[341]</sup></a> An important passage preserved
by Seneca survives. In this passage Brutus relates that he
had just seen M. Marcellus at Mitylene, the same whom
Caesar pardoned later at the request of Cicero. He found
him employed in serious studies, easily forgetting Rome
and its pleasures, and enjoying in this tranquillity and leisure
a happiness that he had never known before. “When I
had to leave him,” says he, “and saw that I was going away
without him, it seemed to me that it was I who was going into
exile, and not Marcellus, who remained there.”<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c013'><sup>[342]</sup></a> From this
example he concludes that a man must not complain of being
exiled since he can carry all his virtue with him. The moral
of the book was that to live happily one need not go outside
of oneself. This is another truism, if you like; but, in
trying to conform his whole life to this maxim, Brutus made
it a living truth. It was not a philosophical thesis that he
developed, but a rule of conduct that he proposed to others
and took for himself. He was early accustomed to commune
with his own thoughts, and to place in this his
pleasures and pains. Thence came that freedom of mind
that he preserved in the gravest affairs, that contempt for outward
things that all his contemporaries remarked, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>ease with which he detached himself from them. On the
eve of Pharsalia, when every one was restless and uneasy, he
was tranquilly reading Polybius and taking notes while awaiting
the moment of combat. After the Ides of March, in
the midst of the excitement and fears of his friends, he
alone preserved a constant serenity that rather annoyed
Cicero. Driven away from Rome and threatened by
Caesar’s veterans, he consoled himself for everything by
saying: “There is nothing better than to rest upon the
memory of one’s good actions, and not to busy oneself with
events or men.”<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c013'><sup>[343]</sup></a> This capacity for abstraction from outward
things and this self-sufficingness are certainly valuable
qualities in a man of reflection and study: it is the ideal that
a philosopher proposes to himself; but is it not a danger
and a fault in a man of action and a politician? Is it right
for a man to hold himself aloof from the opinions of others
when the success of the things he undertakes depends upon
their opinions? Under pretence of listening to one’s conscience,
and resolutely following it, ought a man to take no
account of circumstances, and risk himself heedlessly in
useless adventures? Indeed, by wishing to keep aloof
from the multitude, and preserve himself entirely from its
passions, does he not risk the loss of the tie that binds him
to it and becoming incapable of leading it? Appian, in the
narrative that he gives of the last campaign of the Republican
army, relates that Brutus was always self-possessed, and
that he kept himself almost aloof from the grave affairs that
were discussed. He liked conversation and reading; he
visited as a connoisseur the places they passed through, and
made the people of the country talk to him: he was a
philosopher in the midst of camps. Cassius, on the contrary,
occupied solely with the war, never allowing himself
to be turned aside, and, so to say, wholly intent upon that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>end, resembled a fighting gladiator.<a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c013'><sup>[344]</sup></a> I suspect that Brutus
must have rather disdained that feverish activity entirely
confined to ordinary duties, and that this <i><span lang="fr">rôle</span></i> of gladiator
made him smile. He was wrong; success in human things
belongs to the gladiator, and a man only succeeds by throwing
his whole soul into them. As to those speculative men,
wrapped up in themselves, who wish to keep outside of and
above the passions of the day, they astonish the multitude
but do not lead it; they may be sages, they make very bad
party leaders.</p>

<p class='c014'>And further, it is very possible that Brutus, if left to himself,
would not have thought of becoming a party leader.
He was not hostile to the new government, and Caesar had
neglected no opportunity of attaching him to himself by
granting him the pardon of some of the very much compromised
Pompeians. On his return to Rome he confided
to him the government of one of the finest provinces of the
empire, Cisalpine Gaul. About the same time the news
came of the defeat of the republican army at Thapsus, and
the death of Cato. No doubt Brutus felt it very much.
He himself wrote and persuaded Cicero to compose the
eulogy of his uncle; but we know from Plutarch that he
blamed him for refusing Caesar’s clemency. When Marcellus,
who had just obtained his pardon, was assassinated
near Athens, some persons affected to believe and to say
that Caesar might well have been an accomplice in this
crime. Brutus hastened to write, with a warmth that surprised
Cicero, to exculpate him. He was at that time, then,
quite under the spell of Caesar. We may add that he had
taken a horror of civil war in Pompey’s camp. It had
carried off some of his dearest friends, for instance Torquatus
and Triarius, two young men of great promise,
whose loss he bitterly regretted. In thinking of the disorders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>it had caused, and of the victims it had made, he no
doubt said with his friend, the philosopher Favonius: “It
is better to endure arbitrary power than to revive impious
wars.”<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c013'><sup>[345]</sup></a> How, then, did he allow himself to be drawn on
to recommence them? By what clever conspiracy did his
friends succeed in overcoming his repugnance, in arming
him against a man he loved, in involving him in an enterprise
that was to throw the world into confusion? This
deserves to be related, and Cicero’s letters allow us to catch
a glimpse of it.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>III.</h4>

<p class='c015'>After Pharsalia, there was no want of malcontents. That
great aristocracy that had governed the world so long, could
not consider itself beaten after a single defeat. It was so
much the more natural that it should wish to make a last
effort, as it was well aware that, the first time, it had not
fought under favourable conditions, and that, in uniting its
cause to Pompey’s, it had placed itself in a bad position.
Pompey inspired little more confidence in those who desired
liberty than Caesar. It was known that he had a
taste for extraordinary powers, and that he liked to concentrate
all public authority in his hands. At the commencement
of the civil war he had rejected the most just proposals
with so much haughtiness, and shown so much
ardour in precipitating the crisis, that he seemed rather to
wish to get rid of a rival who hampered him than to come
to the aid of the threatened republic. His friend Cicero
tells us that when the insolence of his associates, and his
own persistency in not taking advice from any one, were
seen in his camp, it was suspected that a man who took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>counsel so ill before the battle would wish to make himself
master after the victory. That is why so many good
citizens, and Cicero among the chief, had hesitated so
long to take his part; that is, above all, why intrepid men
like Brutus had hastened to lay down their arms after the
first defeat. It must be added that, if they were not perfectly
satisfied about Pompey’s intentions, it was also possible
they might be mistaken about Caesar’s projects. No
one was ignorant that he wished for power; but what kind
of power? Was it only one of those temporary dictatorships,
necessary in free states after a period of anarchy,
which suspend liberty but do not annihilate it? Was it a
question of repeating the history of Marius and Sulla, whom
the republic had survived? In strictness it might be
thought so, and nothing prevents us supposing that
several of Caesar’s officers, those especially who, when
undeceived later, conspired against him, did not think so
then.</p>

<p class='c014'>But after Pharsalia there was no longer any means of preserving
this illusion. Caesar did not demand an exceptional
authority; he aspired to found a new government. Had
he not been heard to say that “republic” was a word void
of meaning, and that Sulla was a fool to have abdicated the
dictatorship? His measures for regulating the exercise of
the popular suffrage in his own interest, the choice that he
had made in advance of consuls and praetors for several
years running, the delivery of the public treasure and the
administration of the revenue of the state by his freedmen
and slaves, the union of all dignities in his own person, the
censorship under the name of praefecture of morals, the perpetual
dictatorship, which did not prevent him getting himself
appointed consul every year; everything, in fine, in his
laws and in his conduct indicated a definitive taking possession
of power. Far from taking any of those precautions to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>hide the extent of his authority that Augustus employed
later, he seemed to exhibit it with complacency, and without
concerning himself about the enemies that his frankness
might make him. On the contrary, by a sort of ironical
scepticism and bold impertinence, that betrayed the great
nobleman, he loved to shock the fanatical partisans of
ancient usages. He smiled at seeing pontifs and augurs
scared when he dared to deny the gods in full senate, and
it was his amusement to disconcert those ceremonious old
men, the superstitious guardians of ancient practices. Further,
as he was a man of pleasure before all things, he loved
power not only for the sake of exercising it, but also to
enjoy its fruits; he was not contented with the reality of
sovereign authority, he wished also for its outward signs, the
splendour that surrounds it, the homage it exacts, the pomp
that sets it off, and even the name that designates it. He
knew well how much that title of king that he so ardently
desired frightened the Romans; but his hardihood took
pleasure in braving old prejudices at the same time that his
candour no doubt thought it more honourable to give its real
name to the power he exercised. The result of this conduct
of Caesar was to dissipate all doubts. Thanks to it, illusion
or misunderstanding was no longer possible. The question
was now, not between two ambitious rivals, as at the time
of Pharsalia, but between two opposite forms of government.
Opinions, as sometimes happens, became clearly defined
one by the other, and the intention of founding a monarchy,
which Caesar openly avowed, brought about the creation of
a great republican party.</p>

<p class='c014'>How was it that in this party the boldest and most violent
men formed the idea of uniting and organizing themselves?
How, with growing confidence, did they come to form a
plot against the life of the dictator? It is impossible to
find this out exactly. All that we know is that the first idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>of the plot had been formed at the same time in two quite
opposite parties, among the vanquished of Pharsalia, and,
what is more surprising, among Caesar’s generals themselves.
These two conspiracies were probably distinct in
origin, and each acted on its own account: while Cassius
was thinking of killing Caesar on the banks of the Cydnus,
Trebonius had been on the point of assassinating him at
Narbonne. They finally united.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every party begins by seeking a leader. If they had
wished to continue the traditions of the preceding war, this
leader was already at hand. Sextus, a son of Pompey, remained.
He had escaped by a miracle from Pharsalia and
Munda, and had survived all his family. Conquered, but
not discouraged, he wandered in the mountains or along the
shores, by turns an able partisan or a bold pirate, and the
obstinate Pompeians united around him. But men no
longer desired to be of a Pompeian party. They wished to
have some one for chief who represented not merely a name
but a principle, one who should represent the republic and
liberty without any personal reservations. It was necessary
that he should be in complete opposition to the government
they were going to attack, by his life, his manners, and his
character. He must be upright, because the power was corrupt,
disinterested, in order to protest against the insatiable
greed that surrounded Caesar, already illustrious, in order
that the different elements of which the party was composed
should give way to him, and still young, for they had need of
a bold stroke. Now, there was only one man who united all
these qualities, namely Brutus. Consequently, the eyes of
every one were fixed on him. The public voice marked him
out as the chief of the republican party while he was still
the friend of Caesar. When the first conspirators went to
all quarters seeking accomplices, they always received the
same answer: “We will join you if Brutus will lead us.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>Caesar himself, notwithstanding his confidence and his
friendship, seemed sometimes to have a presentiment whence
the danger would come to him. One day when they were
trying to alarm him with the discontent and threats of
Antony and Dolabella: “No,” he replied, “those debauchees
are not to be feared; it is the thin and pale men.”
He meant chiefly to indicate Brutus.</p>

<p class='c014'>To this pressure of public opinion, which wished to direct
the action of Brutus, and to implicate him without his
assent, it was necessary to add more formal exhortations in
order to persuade him; they came to him from all sides. I
have no need to recall those notes that he found in his
tribunal, those inscriptions that were placed at the foot of his
grandfather’s statue,<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c013'><sup>[346]</sup></a> and all those clever manœuvres that
Plutarch has so well narrated. But no one better served the
designs of those who wished to make Brutus a conspirator
than Cicero, who, however, did not know them. His letters
show us the disposition of his mind at that time. Spite,
anger, regret for lost liberty break out in them with singular
vivacity. “I am ashamed of being a slave,”<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c013'><sup>[347]</sup></a> he wrote one
day to Cassius, without suspecting that at that very moment
Cassius was secretly searching for the means of being so no
longer. It was impossible that these sentiments should not
come to light in the books he published at that time. We
find them there now that we read them in cold blood; much
more must they have been seen when these books were commented
on by hatred and read with eyes rendered penetrating
by passion. How many epigrams were then appreciated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>which now escape us! What stinging and bitter words,
unperceived now, were then applauded and maliciously
repeated in those conversations where the master and
his friends were pulled to pieces! There was in them
what Cicero wittily calls “the bite of liberty which never
tears better than when she has been muzzled for some
time.”<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c013'><sup>[348]</sup></a> With a little effort we find allusions everywhere.
If the author spoke with so much admiration of the ancient
eloquence, it was because he wished to put to shame that
deserted Forum and that mute senate; the memories of the
old government were only recalled in order to attack the
new one, and the praise of the dead became the satire of
the living. Cicero well understood the whole import of his
books when he said of them later: “They served me as a
senate or a rostrum from which I could speak.”<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c013'><sup>[349]</sup></a> Nothing
served more to stir up public opinion, to put regret for the
past and disgust for the present into men’s minds, and thus
to prepare the events which were to follow.</p>

<p class='c014'>Brutus must have been more moved than any one else
in reading Cicero’s writings; they were dedicated to him;
they were written for him. Although they were meant to
influence the whole public, they contained passages addressed
more directly to him. Cicero not only sought to
arouse his patriotic sentiments; he recalled the memories
and hopes of his youth. With perfidious skill he even interested
his vanity in the restoration of the ancient government
by pointing out what a position he might make for
himself in it. “Brutus,” he said, “I feel my grief revive
when I look upon you and consider how the unhappy fate
of the republic has arrested the rapid advance to glory
which we anticipated in your youth. This is the true
cause of my sorrow, this is the cause of my cares and of
those of Atticus, who shares in my esteem and affection for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>you. You are the object of all our interest, we desire that
you should reap the fruits of your virtue; our most earnest
wishes are that the conditions of the republic may permit
you one day to revive and increase the glory of the two
illustrious houses you represent. You ought to be master
in the Forum and reign there without a rival; we are, in
truth, doubly afflicted, that the republic is lost for you, and
you for the republic.”<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c013'><sup>[350]</sup></a> Such regrets, expressed in this
fashion, and with this mixture of private and public interests,
were well calculated to disturb Brutus. Antony was not
altogether wrong when he accused Cicero of having been an
accomplice in the death of Caesar. If he did not himself
strike, he armed the hands that struck, and the conspirators
were perfectly right when, on coming from the senate house,
after the Ides of March, they brandished their bloody
swords and called aloud upon Cicero.</p>

<p class='c014'>To these incitements from without there were added
others of a still more powerful kind from Brutus’ own
household. His mother had always used the influence she
had over him to draw him towards Caesar; but just at this
critical time Servilia’s influence was lessened by the
marriage of Brutus with his cousin Porcia. Daughter of
Cato and widow of Bibulus, Porcia brought into her new
home, all the passions of her father and her first husband,
and especially hatred of Caesar, who had caused all her misfortunes.
She had scarcely entered when disagreements
arose between her and her mother-in-law. Cicero, who
tells us of them, does not relate to us their cause; but it is
not rash to suppose that these two women contended for
the affection of Brutus, and that they wished to rule him
that they might draw him in different directions. Servilia’s
influence no doubt lost something in these domestic discussions,
and her voice, opposed by the advice of a new and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>beloved wife, had no longer the same authority when it
spoke for Caesar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus everything combined to lead Brutus on. Let us
conceive this hesitating and scrupulous man attacked on so
many sides at once, by the incitements of public opinion,
by memories of the past, by the traditions of his family and
the very name he bore, by those secret reproaches placed
under his hands and scattered on his path, which came every
moment to strike his inattentive eyes, to murmur in his heedless
ear, and then finding at home the same memories and
the same reproaches under the form of legitimate sorrows
and touching regrets. Must he not at last give way to
this daily assault? Nevertheless it is probable that he
resisted before giving in, that he had violent struggles
during those sleepless nights that Plutarch speaks of; but
as these private struggles could have no confidants they have
left no trace in the historians.</p>

<p class='c014'>All that we can do if we wish to know them is, to try and
find their faint impression in the letters that Brutus wrote
later, and that are preserved. We see, for instance, that he
returns at two different times to this same thought: “Our
ancestors thought that we ought not to endure a tyrant even
if he were our own father.<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c013'><sup>[351]</sup></a>... To have more authority
than the laws and the senate is a right that I would not
grant to my father himself.”<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c013'><sup>[352]</sup></a> Is not this the answer which
he made every time he felt himself moved by the memory
of Caesar’s paternal affection, when he reflected that this
man against whom he was about to take arms called him his
child? As to the favours that he had received or that he
might expect from him, they might have been able to disarm
another, but he hardened and stiffened himself against
them. “No slavery is advantageous enough to make me
abandon the resolution to be free.”<a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c013'><sup>[353]</sup></a> It was with such considerations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>that he defended himself against the friends
of the dictator, perhaps against his mother, when in order
to dazzle him she pointed out to him that, if he would
acquiesce in the kingship of Caesar he might hope to share
it. He would never have consented to pay with his liberty
the right to domineer over others; the bargain would have
been too disadvantageous. “It is better to command no
one than to be a slave,” he wrote. “A man can live without
commanding, but life as a slave is worthless.”<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c013'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>In the midst of all these anxieties of which no one could
know, an event happened which very much surprised the
public, and which Cicero’s letters relate without explanation.
When it was known that Caesar was returning to
Rome after his victory over Pompey, Brutus went to meet
him with an alacrity that everybody remarked, and that
many people blamed. What was his intention? A few
words of Cicero, to which sufficient attention has not been
paid, allow us to guess. Before taking a definite resolution,
Brutus wished to make a last appeal to Caesar, and to try
once more to draw him towards the republic. He made a
point of commending to him the men of the vanquished
party, and especially Cicero, in the hope that they might be
recalled to public office. Caesar listened kindly to these
praises, welcomed Brutus, and did not discourage him too
much. The latter, with too easy confidence, hastened to
return to Rome, and announce to every one that Caesar was
coming back to the party of honest men. He went so
far as to advise Cicero to address a political letter to the
dictator, which should contain some good advice and make
some advances; but Cicero did not share in his friend’s
hopes, and after a little hesitation, refused to write. In
truth, Brutus’ illusions did not last long. Antony had anticipated
him with Caesar. Antony, who by his follies had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>disturbed the tranquillity of Rome, had much to be pardoned
for; but he well knew the means of succeeding in
this. While Brutus was trying to bring Caesar and the
republicans together, and thought he had succeeded,
Antony, in order to soften his master, flattered his most
cherished wishes, and no doubt made that crown which he
so anxiously desired, glitter before his eyes. The scene of the
Lupercalia showed clearly that Antony had carried the day
and it was no longer possible for Brutus to doubt Caesar’s
intentions. Antony’s plan, indeed, did not succeed this
time: the cries of the multitude, and the opposition of the
two tribunes, forced Caesar to refuse the diadem that was
offered him; but it was well known that this check had not
discouraged him. The occasion was only deferred, and was
about to present itself again. With regard to the Parthian
war, an old Sybilline oracle which said that the Parthians
would only be conquered by a king was to be brought
before the senate, and this title was to be demanded for
Caesar. Now there were too many foreigners and too many
cowards in the senate to admit of the answer being doubtful.
This was the moment that Cassius chose to reveal to
Brutus the plot that was being hatched, and to ask him
to be its head.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cassius, whose name becomes from this moment inseparable
from that of Brutus, formed a complete contrast to him.
He had gained a great military reputation by saving the
remains of Crassus’ army and driving the Parthians from
Syria; but at the same time he was charged with being fond
of pleasure, an epicurean in doctrine and conduct, eager for
power, and not very scrupulous about the means of gaining
it. He had pillaged the province he governed, like almost
all the proconsuls; it was said that Syria had found little
advantage in being saved by him, and would almost as soon
have passed into the hands of the Parthians. Cassius was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>bitter in raillery, uneven in temper, hasty, sometimes cruel,<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c013'><sup>[355]</sup></a>
and we can well understand that he would not have shrunk
from an assassination; but whence came the idea of killing
Caesar? Plutarch says that it was through spite at not
having obtained the urban praetorship which the dictator’s
favour had accorded to Brutus, and indeed, nothing prevents
us thinking that personal resentment had embittered
that impetuous spirit. Yet if Cassius had only this insult to
avenge it is not probable that he would have acted in concert
with the man who had been a party to it and had
profited by it. He had quite other motives for hating
Caesar. An aristocrat by birth and temper, his heart was
full of the hatred felt by the vanquished aristocracy; he
must have a bloody revenge for the defeat of his party, and
Caesar’s pardon had not extinguished the anger that the
sight of his oppressed caste aroused in him. Thus, while
Brutus sought to be the man of a principle, Cassius was
openly the man of a party. It seems that he early had the
idea of avenging Pharsalia by an assassination. At least,
Cicero says that, a very few months after he had obtained
his pardon, he waited for Caesar on one bank of the Cydnus
to kill him, and that Caesar was saved only by the accident
that made him land on the other bank. He resumed his
purpose at Rome, notwithstanding the favours of which he
had been the object. It was he who got up the conspiracy,
sought out the malcontents, and brought them together in
secret meetings; and as he saw that they all demanded
Brutus for leader, he took upon himself to speak to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were still at variance in consequence of their rivalry
for the urban praetorship. Cassius put his resentment aside
and visited his brother-in-law. “He took him by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>hand,” as Appian relates, and said: “‘What shall we do if
Caesar’s flatterers propose to make him king?’ Brutus
answered that he purposed not to go to the senate. ‘What?’
replied Cassius. ‘If we are summoned in our capacity as
praetors, what must we do then?’ ‘I will defend the republic,’
said the other, ‘to the last.’ ‘Will you not then,’ replied
Cassius, embracing him, ‘take some of the senators, as
parties to your designs? Do you think it is worthless and
mercenary people, or the chief citizens of Rome who
place on your tribunal the writings you find there? They
expect games, races or hunting spectacles from the other
praetors; what they demand of you is that you should
restore liberty to Rome, as your ancestors did.’”<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c013'><sup>[356]</sup></a> These
words completely gained over a mind that so many private
and public solicitations had unsettled for so long. Still
hesitating, but already almost gained, it only waited to find
itself face to face with a firm resolution in order to yield.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last the conspiracy had a leader, and there was no
longer any reason to hesitate or to wait. To avoid indiscretions
or weaknesses it was necessary to act quickly.
Cassius had revealed everything to Brutus a short time
after the feast of the Lupercalia, which was kept on
February 15, and less than a month after, on March 15,
Caesar was struck down in the curia of Pompey.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>IV.</h4>

<p class='c015'>Brutus was in reality the head of the conspiracy, although
he had not formed the first idea of it. Cassius alone, who
had formed it, could dispute the right of conducting it
with him, and perhaps he had for an instant the intention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>of doing so. We see that at first he proposed a plan
in which all the violence of his character is shown.
He wished that, with Caesar, they should kill his chief
friends, and especially Antony. Brutus refused, and the
other conspirators were of his mind. Cassius himself
yielded at last, for it must be remarked that, although
imperious and haughty, he submitted to the ascendency of
Brutus. He tried several times to escape from it; but
after many threats and fits of anger, he felt himself overcome
by the cold reasoning of his friend, and it was Brutus
who really conducted the whole enterprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is clearly seen, and in the manner in which it was
conceived and executed we find his character and turn of
mind. We have not an ordinary conspiracy before us,
we have not to do with professional conspirators, with
men of violence and adventures. They are not vulgarly
ambitious men who covet the fortune or honours of others,
nor even madmen whom political hatred misleads even to
frenzy. No doubt these sentiments were found in the hearts
of many of the conspirators; historians say so, but Brutus
forced them to lie hid. He made a point of accomplishing
his action with a sort of quiet dignity. It was the
system alone that he aimed at; he was animated by no
hatred against the man. After having struck him he does
not insult him; he permits, in spite of many objections, his
funeral to be celebrated, and his will to be read to the
people. What occupies his thoughts most of all is that
he should not appear to work for himself or his friends,
and to avoid all suspicion of personal ambition or party
interest. Such was this conspiracy in which men of very
different characters took part, but which bears the imprint
of Brutus’ own mind. His influence is not less perceptible
on the events that followed it. He did not act at random,
although Cicero accused him of doing so, and everybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>repeats it; he had formed in advance a rule of conduct for
the future, he had a well-defined plan. Unfortunately it
was found that this plan, conceived in solitary reflection, far
from the intercourse and acquaintance of men, could not
be followed out. It was the work of a logician who reasons,
who purposes to conduct himself in the midst of a revolution
as in ordinary times, and wishes to introduce the
narrow respect for legality even into a work of violence.
He acknowledged that he was mistaken, and he had to give
up successively all his scruples; but, as he had not the
pliability of the politician who knows how to submit to
necessity he gave way too late, with a bad grace, and always
looked back with regret to the fine projects he had been
forced to abandon. Thence came his hesitation and incoherence.
It has been said that he failed through not
having had an exact plan in advance; I think, on the
contrary, that he did not succeed through wishing to be
too faithful to the chimerical plan he had conceived, notwithstanding
the lessons given by events. A rapid recital
of the facts will suffice to show that it was this which
caused the loss of himself and his party, and made the
blood that was shed useless.</p>

<p class='c014'>After the death of Caesar, the conspirators came out of
the senate house, brandishing their swords, and calling on
the people. The people listened to them with surprise,
without much anger, but without any sympathy. Seeing
themselves alone, they went up to the Capitol, where they
could defend themselves, and shut themselves in under
the guard of some gladiators. They were joined only by
some doubtful friends who always join parties when they
are successful. If there had been little eagerness to follow
them there was still less desire to attack them. Caesar’s
partisans were scared. Antony had thrown off his consul’s
robe and hidden himself. Dolabella affected to appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>joyful, and let it be understood that he also was one of the
conspirators. Many left Rome in haste, and fled into the
country; yet, when they saw that all remained quiet, and
that the conspirators were contented with making speeches
in the Capitol, courage returned to the most timid. The fear
that this bold action had caused gave place to surprise at
such strange inaction. The next day Antony had resumed
his consular robes, reassembled his friends, and recovered
his audacity, and it was necessary to reckon with him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They have acted,” said Cicero, “with manly courage,
but childish judgment; <i><span lang="la">animo virili, consilio puerili</span></i>.”<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c013'><sup>[357]</sup></a> It is
certain that they seemed to have prepared nothing, and
to have foreseen nothing. On the evening of the Ides of
March they were awaiting events without having done
anything to guide them. Was it, as has been said, improvidence
and levity? No, it was system and deliberate
intention. Brutus had only joined the others to deliver
the republic from the man who prevented the free play of
the institutions. He being dead, the people regained their
rights, and became free again to use them. The conspirators
would have appeared to be working for themselves
in keeping even for a day that authority that they had
torn from Caesar. Now, to prepare decrees or laws in
advance, to arrange about regulating the future, to consider
the means of giving affairs the direction they wished, was
not this to take upon themselves in some sort the duty of
the entire republic? And what more had Caesar done?
Thus, on pain of appearing to imitate him, and to have
acted only through the rivalry of ambition, once the great
blow struck, the conspirators had to abdicate. This is how
I think their conduct must be explained. It was by a
strange prejudice of disinterestedness and of legality that
they remained voluntarily disarmed. They thought it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>glorious to act in concert only so far as to kill Caesar.
That act accomplished, they were to restore to the people
the direction of their affairs, and the choice of their government,
leaving them free to express their gratitude to those
who had delivered them, or if they so willed it, to repay
them by forgetfulness.</p>

<p class='c014'>There the illusion commenced: they thought there was
only Caesar between the people and liberty, and that when
Caesar no longer existed liberty would naturally reappear;
but on the day that they called on the citizens to resume
their rights, no one answered, and no one could answer, for
there were no longer any citizens. “For a very long time,”
says Appian on this occasion, “the Roman people was only a
mixture of all the nations. The freedmen were confounded
with the citizens, the slave had no longer anything to
distinguish him from his master. In sum, the distributions
of corn that were made at Rome gathered the beggars, the
idle, and the scoundrels from all Italy.”<a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c013'><sup>[358]</sup></a> This cosmopolitan
population, without a past and without traditions, was
not the Roman people. The evil was old, and clear-sighted
minds must have perceived it for a long time. Cicero
seems to suspect it sometimes, especially when he sees
with what facility they traffic in votes at the elections.
Nevertheless everything continued with apparent regularity,
and things went on from the impulse they had received.
In such a condition of affairs, and when a state only moves
through habit, all is lost if this movement is arrested for a
single day. Now, with Caesar, the old machinery ceased to
act. The interruption was not long, but the machine was
so dilapidated that in stopping it fell to pieces entirely.
Thus the conspirators could not restore what was existing
before the civil war, and this last shadow of the republic,
imperfect as it was, disappeared for ever.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>This is why no one either listened to or followed them.
Courage must have failed more than one of them in that
Capitol where they were left alone, at the sight of the indifference
of the populace. Cicero especially was distressed
at seeing that they did nothing but make fine speeches.
He wished them to act, to profit by the occasion, to die if
need were: “Would not death be glorious for such a great
cause?” This old man, usually irresolute, had then more
resolution than all those young men who had just struck so
bold a stroke. And yet, what did he suggest after all?
“You must rouse the people again,” he said. We have
just seen that the people would not respond. “You must
convoke the senate, and take advantage of its fears, to
extort some favourable decrees.”<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c013'><sup>[359]</sup></a> Assuredly the senate
would have voted whatever they wished: but when the
decrees had been made, how were they to be executed?
All these schemes were insufficient, and it was hardly
possible to propose anything more practical to men who
were determined not to overstep the law. The only
possible chance was boldly to seize the government, to
hold it by violence and illegality, not even flinching from
proscription, and to replace by an aristocratic dictatorship
that popular tyranny they had just destroyed; in a word, to
recommence the history of Sulla. Cassius perhaps would
have done this, but Brutus had a horror of violence.
Tyranny, from whatever side it might come, seemed to
him a crime; he would rather have perished with the
republic than save it by these means.</p>

<p class='c014'>The few succeeding days passed in strange alternations.
There was a sort of interregnum during which the parties
contended with varying success. The people, who had not
followed the conspirators, did not support their enemies
either. As they did not know on what to rely men acted on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>both sides at random, and frequently in a contradictory and
surprising manner. One day an amnesty was proclaimed,
and Brutus went to dine with Lepidus; the next, the conspirators’
houses were set on fire. After having abolished
the dictatorship they ratified the acts of the dictator. The
friends of Caesar erected a column and an altar to him on
the Forum; another friend of Caesar had them thrown
down. It was in the midst of this confusion, while the two
parties were wavering, undecided and hesitating, without
daring to strike, while each was looking around it to see
where the real forces were, that those who henceforth were
to be the masters appeared.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a long time a secret revolution had been in operation
at Rome, which had been scarcely perceived because its
progress was slow and continuous, but which, when it was
complete, changed the character of the state. Campaigns had
been short while they had only been fought in the neighbourhood
of Rome and in Italy. The citizens had not had time
to lose the traditions of civil life in the camp; there had not
been a family either soldiers by trade, or generals by profession.
But in proportion as wars were more distant, and
lasted longer, the men who carried them on became accustomed
to living at a distance from Rome. They lost
sight of the Forum for so long a time that they forgot its
controversies and customs. At the same time, as the right
of citizenship was extended, the legion was thrown open to
men of all races. This medley completed the destruction
of the ties that bound the soldier to the city; he acquired
the habit of isolating himself from it, of having separate
interests, and of looking on the camp as his country.
After the great Gallic war, which lasted ten years, Caesar’s
veterans no longer remembered that they were citizens, and
their recollections did not go back beyond Ariovistus and
Vercingetorix. When it had become necessary to reward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>them, Caesar, who was not ungrateful, distributed the finest
lands of Italy among them; and this partition was made
under new conditions. Up to that time the soldiers, after
the war, returned into the mass of the people: when they
were sent to a colony, they were lost, and, as it were, absorbed
among the other citizens; but now they passed without
transition from their camp to the domains that had been
given them, and thus the military spirit was preserved
among them. As they were not far removed from one
another, and could communicate with each other, they did
not altogether lose the taste for a life of adventure. “They
compared,” says Appian, “the toilsome labour of agriculture
with the brilliant and lucrative chances of battles.”<a id='r360'></a><a href='#f360' class='c013'><sup>[360]</sup></a> They
formed then in the heart of Italy a population of soldiers,
listening for rumours of war, and ready to answer the first
call.</p>

<p class='c014'>Precisely at that time there were many in Rome, whom
Caesar had called there while they were waiting for him
to grant them lands. Others were close at hand, in Campania,
busied in settling themselves down, and perhaps
disgusted with these preliminary toils of their settlement.
Some among them had returned to Rome on the rumour
of the events that were taking place, the rest were waiting to
be well paid before deciding, and put themselves up to
auction. Now, there was no want of buyers. The heritage
of the great dictator tempted every one’s cupidity. Thanks
to those soldiers who were ready to sell their services, each
of the competitors had his partisans and his chances. Antony
was predominant over all by the lustre of his consular
authority, and the memory of Caesar’s friendship; but near
him was the debauchee Dolabella, who had held out hopes
to all parties, and the young Octavius, who came from
Epirus to receive the inheritance of his uncle. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>no one, even to the incapable Lepidus, who had not got
several legions in his interest, and who did not make some
figure among these ambitious men. And all, surrounded
by soldiers whom they had bought, masters of important
provinces, watched each other mistrustfully while waiting to
fight.</p>

<p class='c014'>What was Brutus doing in the meantime? The opportunity
of the Ides of March having failed, he might still have
taken advantage of the quarrels of the Caesarians to throw
himself upon them and crush them. The resolute men of
his party advised him to try this, and to call to arms all
those young men who, in Italy and the provinces, had
applauded the death of Caesar; but Brutus hated civil war
and could not resolve to give the signal anew. As he had
fancied that the people would hasten to accept the liberty
that was given back to them, he had thought that the
restoration of the republic could be made without violence.
One illusion led him to another, and that stab which began
a frightful war of twelve years seemed to him bound to
assure public tranquillity for ever. It was in this belief
that, on coming out of the curia of Pompey where he had
just killed Caesar, he ran through the streets crying, “Peace!
peace!” And this word was henceforth his motto. When
his friends, on learning the dangers he was running, came
from the neighbouring municipia to defend him, he sent
them back. He preferred to remain shut up in his house
rather than give any pretext for the commencement of violence.
Forced to leave Rome, he remained hidden in the gardens
of the neighbourhood, disturbed by the soldiers, only going
out at night, but always expecting that great popular movement
that he persisted in hoping for. No one moved. He
removed still further and took refuge in his villas of Lanuvium
and Antium. There he heard the rumours of war
with which Italy resounded, and saw all parties preparing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>fight. He alone always resisted. He passed six entire
months shrinking from this terrible necessity that became
more clearly inevitable every day. He could not resolve
to accept it, and asked advice of everybody.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero even tells, in his letters,<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c013'><sup>[361]</sup></a> of a sort of council that
was held at Antium, to consider what it was needful to do.
Servilia was there with Porcia, Brutus with Cassius, and a
few of the most faithful friends had been invited, among
whom were Favonius and Cicero. Servilia, more anxious
for the safety than the honour of her son, wished him to
withdraw. She had obtained from Antony, who had remained
her friend, for her son and her son-in-law, a <i><span lang="la">legatio</span></i>,
that is a commission to go and collect corn in Sicily. It
was a specious and safe pretext for quitting Italy; but what
a disgrace! to leave with a permission signed by Antony, to
accept exile as a favour. Cassius would not consent; he
spoke with passion, he was indignant, he threatened, “one
would have said he breathed only war.” Brutus, on the
contrary, calm and resigned, questioned his friends, being
resolved to satisfy them at the risk of his life. Did they
wish him to return to Rome? He was ready to go there.
Every one cried out at this proposition. Rome was full of
danger for the conspirators, and they would not uselessly
expose the last hopes of liberty. What should they do
then? They only agreed in bitterly regretting the course
they had followed. Cassius regretted that they had not
killed Antony as he had demanded, and Cicero did not
care to contradict him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Unfortunately these recriminations were of no use; it
was not a question of complaining of the past, the moment
had arrived for regulating the future, and they did not
know what to resolve upon.</p>

<p class='c014'>Brutus did not immediately decide after this meeting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>He persisted in remaining as long as he could in his villa
at Lanuvium, reading and discussing, under his handsome
porticoes, with the Greek philosophers, his usual society.
It was necessary to go away, however. Italy was becoming
less and less safe, the veterans infested the roads and pillaged
the country houses. Brutus went to Velia to join
some vessels that were waiting to conduct him to Greece.
He called his departure an exile, and, by a last illusion, he
hoped that it would not be the signal for war. As Antony
accused him of preparing for this, he replied to him in
Cassius’ name and his own, by an admirable letter of which
this is the end: “Do not flatter yourself that you have
frightened us, fear is beneath our character. If other motives
were capable of giving us any leaning towards civil war your
letter would not take it from us, for threats have no power
over free hearts; but you well know that we hate war, that
nothing can drag us into it, and you put on a threatening
air, no doubt to make men believe that our resolution is the
effect of our fears. These are our sentiments; we wish to
see you live with distinction in a free state; we do not wish
to be your enemies, but we have more regard for liberty
than for your friendship. We therefore pray the gods to
inspire you with counsels salutary for the republic and for
yourself. If not, we desire that your own party may hurt
you as little as possible, and that Rome may be free and
glorious!”<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c013'><sup>[362]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>At Velia, Brutus was joined by Cicero, who also thought of
leaving. Discouraged by the inaction of his friends, terrified
by the threats of his enemies, he had already attempted
to fly to Greece: but the wind had thrown him back on the
coast of Italy. When he learnt that Brutus was going to
leave, he wished to see him again and if possible start with
him. Cicero often spoke with a heartrending accent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>of the emotions of this last interview. “I saw him,” he
related to the people later, “I saw him depart from Italy in
order not to cause a civil war there. O sorrowful spectacle,
I do not say for men only, but for the waves and the shores.
The saviour of his country was forced to flee, its destroyers
remained all-powerful.”<a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c013'><sup>[363]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The last thought of Brutus at this sad moment was still
for the public peace. Notwithstanding so many disappointments
he still reckoned upon the people of Rome; he
thought enough had not been done to arouse their ardour;
he could not resign himself to believe that there were no
longer any citizens. He started with the regret that he had
not essayed another struggle by legal means. Doubtless it
was not possible for him to return to Rome and to reappear
in the senate; but Cicero was less compromised, his fame
extorted respect; men liked to listen to his words. Could
not he attempt this last struggle? Brutus had always
thought so; at this moment he dared to say so. He
pointed out to Cicero a great duty to accomplish, a great
part to play; his advice, his reproaches, his prayers, determined
him to give up his voyage and return to Rome. He
seemed to hear, as he said later, “the voice of his country
recalling him!”<a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c013'><sup>[364]</sup></a> And they separated not to meet again.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was useless, however, for Brutus to resist; the inevitable
tendency of the events against which he had been
struggling for six months, dragged him into civil war. On
leaving Italy he had come to Athens, where he passed his
time in hearing the academician Theomnestes and the peripatetic
Cratippus. Plutarch sees a clever dissimulation in
this conduct. “He was preparing for war,” he says, “in
secret.” Cicero’s letters prove that, on the contrary, it was
the war that went to seek him. Thessaly and Macedonia were
full of Pompey’s old soldiers, who had remained there after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Pharsalia; the islands of the Aegean, the towns of Greece,
which were regarded as a sort of asylum for the exiles,
contained many malcontents who had refused to submit to
Caesar, and since the Ides of March they were the refuge of
all who fled from the domination of Antony. Athens, in
truth, was full of young men of the greatest families of
Rome, republicans by their birth and their age, who went
there to finish their education. They were only waiting for
Brutus in order to take up arms. On his arrival, there was
a great and irresistible movement on all sides, to which he
was constrained to give way himself. Apuleius and Vatinius
brought him the troops that they commanded. The old
soldiers of Macedonia assembled under the command of
Q. Hortensius; so many came from Italy, that the consul
Pansa at last complained and threatened to stop the recruits
of Brutus on their passage. The students of Athens, and
among them Cicero’s son and the young Horace, deserted
their studies and enrolled themselves under him. In a few
months Brutus was master of all Greece, and had eight
legions.</p>

<p class='c014'>At this moment the republican party seemed to awaken
everywhere at once. Cicero had succeeded better than he
had hoped at Rome, and had raised up enemies to Antony,
who had defeated him before Modena. Brutus had just
formed a considerable army in Greece. Cassius went over
Asia recruiting legions on his passage, and all the East had
declared for him. Hope returned to the most timid, and it
seemed that everything was to be hoped for the republic
from the co-operation of so many generous defenders. It
was, however, at this very moment, when it was so necessary
to be united, that the most serious disagreement broke out
between Cicero and Brutus. Whatever vexation it may
cause us, it must be told, for it completes our knowledge of
both.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Cicero was the first to complain. This man, usually so
weak and hesitating, had become singularly energetic since
the death of Caesar. Prudence, clemency, moderation,
great qualities that he appreciated much and readily practised,
seemed no longer suitable to the circumstances of the
time. This great preacher of pacific victories preached
war to everybody; this stern friend of legality asked everybody
to overstep it. “Do not wait for the decrees of the
senate,”<a id='r365'></a><a href='#f365' class='c013'><sup>[365]</sup></a> he said to one. “Be your own senate,”<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c013'><sup>[366]</sup></a> he
wrote to another. To gain his ends, all means, even the
most violent, seemed good to him; all alliances pleased
him, even that of men whom he did not esteem. Brutus,
on the contrary, even while deciding to take up arms,
remained scrupulous and hesitating, and continued to
dislike violence. Although his name has become famous
chiefly through an assassination, blood was repugnant to
him. He spared his enemies when they were in his power,
in opposition to those inhuman laws, accepted by everybody,
which delivered up the vanquished unreservedly to
the will of the victor. He had just given an instance, by
sparing the life of Antony’s brother after having conquered
him. Although he was a bad man, who had shown his gratitude
by attempting to corrupt the soldiers who guarded him,
Brutus had persisted in treating him with kindness. We
should not consider this a great crime, nevertheless they
were very much irritated about it at Rome. The furious
threats of Antony, from whom they had just escaped with
so much difficulty, the remembrance of the terrors they had
endured, and the terrible alternations they had passed
through for six months, had exasperated the most peaceable.
Nothing is more violent than the anger of moderate men
when they are driven to extremities. They wish to make
an end at any price and as soon as possible. They recalled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>the repugnance and slowness with which Brutus had begun
the war. Seeing him so yielding, so clement, they were
afraid of seeing him fall back into his hesitation, and still
further defer the moment of vengeance and security. Cicero
undertook to let Brutus know of their discontent. In his
letter, which we still possess, he enumerates with much force
the mistakes that had been made since the death of Caesar;
he recalls all the weaknesses and hesitations that had discouraged
resolute men, and, what must have especially
wounded Brutus, the absurdity of wishing to establish
public tranquillity by speeches. “Are you ignorant,” said
he, “what is in question at this moment? A band of
scoundrels and wretches threatens even the temples of the
gods, and it is our life or death that is at stake in this war.
Whom are we sparing? What are we doing? Is it wise to
treat gently men who, if they are conquerors, will wipe out
the very traces of our existence?”<a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c013'><sup>[367]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>These reproaches provoked Brutus, and he answered with
recriminations. He also was discontented with the senate
and Cicero. Whatever admiration he may have felt for the
eloquence of the <em>Philippics</em>, many things must have annoyed
him in them. The general tone of these speeches, their
bitter personalities, their fiery invectives, could not be
pleasing to a man who, in striking down Caesar, had wished
to appear passionless, and rather the enemy of a principle
than of a man. Now, if there is a great love of liberty in
the <em>Philippics</em>, there is also a violent personal hatred. We
feel that this enemy of the country is, at the same time, a
private and personal adversary. He had attempted to
enslave Rome, but he had also taken the liberty of quizzing
the weaknesses of the old consular in a very amusing
speech. Cicero’s irritable vanity was roused when he read
this invective: “he took the bit between his teeth,”<a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c013'><sup>[368]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>according to the expression of a contemporary. The
generous hatred he felt against a public enemy was inflamed
by private rancour; a mortal struggle began, followed up
with increasing energy through fourteen orations. “I am
resolved,” said he, “to overwhelm him with invectives, and
to give him over dishonoured to the eternal contempt of
posterity;”<a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c013'><sup>[369]</sup></a> and he kept his word. This passionate
persistence, this impetuous and violent tone must have
annoyed Brutus. Cicero’s flatteries were no less displeasing
to him than his anger. He bore him a grudge for the exaggerated
eulogies that he gave to men who little deserved
them, to those generals who had served every cause, to
those statesmen who had submitted to every government,
to those men of ambition and intrigue of every sort, whom
Cicero had united with so much trouble, to form what he
called the party of the honest men; he was specially vexed
at seeing him lavish praises on the young Octavius, and lay
the republic at his feet; and when he heard him call him
“a divine young man, sent by the gods for the defence of
the country,” he could scarcely contain his anger.</p>

<p class='c014'>Which of the two was right? Brutus assuredly if we
think of the end. We see clearly that Octavius could not
be anything but an ambitious man and a traitor. The
name he bore was an irresistible temptation for him; to
deliver the republic to him was to destroy it. Brutus was
right in thinking that Octavius was more to be dreaded
than Antony, and his hatred did not mislead him, when
he foresaw in this <em>divine young man</em>, who was so much
praised by Cicero, the future master of the empire, the heir
and successor of him whom he had slain. Was it really
Cicero who was to blame, or only the circumstances?
When he accepted the aid of Octavius was he at liberty to
refuse it? The republic had not, at that time, a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>soldier to oppose Antony, they had to take those of
Octavius or to perish. After he had saved the republic, it
would have been ungracious to haggle with him over thanks
and dignities. Besides, his veterans demanded them in a
way that did not brook refusal, and often gave them to him
in advance. The senate sanctioned everything as quickly
as possible, for fear that they would do without its assent.
“Circumstances,” says Cicero somewhere, “gave him the
command, we have only added the fasces.”<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c013'><sup>[370]</sup></a> Thus, before
blaming Cicero’s compliance, or complaining of his weakness,
they should have thought of the difficulties of his
position. He tried to re-establish the republic by the help
of men who had fought against it and did not love it.
What reliance could he place on Hirtius, the framer of a
severe law against the Pompeians, on Plancus and Pollio,
old lieutenants of Caesar, on Lepidus and Octavius, each
of whom wished to take his place? and yet he had no
other support than they. To that great and ambitious
man who, on the morrow of the Ides of March, wished
to make himself master, he could only oppose a coalition
of inferior or concealed ambitions. Nothing was more
difficult than to steer one’s way in the midst of all these
open or secret rivalries. It was necessary to curb one by
the other, to flatter them in order to lead them, to content
them in part in order to keep them within bounds. Hence
those lavish grants or promises of honours, that profusion of
praises and titles, and those exaggerated official thanks.
This was a necessity imposed by the circumstances; instead
of considering it a crime in Cicero to have submitted to it,
they should have drawn this conclusion, namely, that to
attempt another struggle by legal means, to return to Rome
to arouse the ardour of the populace, to trust again in
the force of memories, and the supreme power of oratory,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>was to expose oneself to useless dangers and certain disappointment.
Cicero knew this well. Sometimes, no
doubt, in the heat of combat, he might allow himself to be
carried away by the triumphs of his eloquence, as on that
day, when he wrote naïvely to Cassius: “If one could
speak oftener it would not be very difficult to re-establish
the republic and liberty.”<a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c013'><sup>[371]</sup></a> But this illusion never lasted
long. The momentary intoxication over, he was not long
in recognizing the impotence of oratory, and was the first to
say they could only place their hopes on the republican
army. He never changed that opinion. “You tell me,” he
wrote to Atticus, “that I am wrong in thinking that the
republic depends entirely upon Brutus; nothing is more certainly
true. If it can be saved at all, it can only be by him
and his friends.”<a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c013'><sup>[372]</sup></a> Cicero had undertaken this last enterprise
without illusions and without hope, and solely to yield to
the wishes of Brutus, who persisted in his love of constitutional
resistance and pacific struggles. Brutus, then, had
less right than any one to reproach him with having
succumbed. Cicero was right in often recalling that interview
at Velia, when his friend persuaded him, notwithstanding
his hesitation, to return to Rome. This recollection
was his defence; it should have prevented Brutus
uttering any bitter word against him, whom he had himself
led into a useless enterprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cicero must have deeply felt these reproaches, yet his
friendship for Brutus remained unaltered by them. He
still looks to him, he calls upon him, when all seems lost
in Italy. Nothing is more touching than his last cry of
alarm: “We are the sport, my dear Brutus, of the licence
of the soldiers and the insolence of their leader. Every one
wishes to have as much authority in the republic as he has
force. Men no longer know reason, measure, law, nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>duty; they no longer care for public opinion or the judgment
of posterity. Come, then, and give at length to the
republic that liberty which you have gained for it by your
courage, but which we cannot yet enjoy. Every one will
press around you; liberty has no refuge but in your tents.
This is our position at this moment; would that it might
become better! If it chances otherwise I shall only weep
for the republic; it ought to be immortal. As for myself, I
have but a little time to live!”<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c013'><sup>[373]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>A very few months afterwards, Lepidus, Antony, and
Octavius, triumvirs to reconstitute the republic, as they
called themselves, assembled near Bologna. They knew
each other too well not to be aware that they were capable
of anything, consequently they had taken minute precautions
against each other. The interview took place on
an island, and they arrived with an equal number of troops
who were not to lose sight of them. For still greater
security, and for fear that any one should carry a hidden
dagger, they went so far as to search each other. After
having thus reassured themselves, they held a long conference.
There was no longer any question of reconstituting
the republic; what occupied their attention most,
besides the division of power, was vengeance, and they
carefully drew up a list of those who were to be slain. Dio
Cassius remarks that, as they detested each other profoundly,
a man was sure, if he was closely connected with one of
them, to be the mortal enemy of the other two, so that
each demanded precisely the heads of the best friends of
his new allies. But this difficulty did not stop them; their
gratitude was much less exacting than their hatred, and in
purchasing the death of an enemy with that of a few friends
or even relations, they thought they made a good bargain.
Thanks to these mutual concessions, they soon came to an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>agreement, and the list was drawn up. Cicero was not
forgotten in it, as we can well understand; Antony urgently
demanded him, and it is not probable, whatever the writers
of the empire may say, that Octavius defended him with
much zeal; he would have constantly recalled to him a
troublesome gratitude and a glaring act of perjury.</p>

<p class='c014'>With the death of Cicero we have reached the end of
this work, since we only proposed to study the relations of
Cicero and Brutus. If we wished to carry it further, and to
know Brutus’ end as well, it would suffice to read the
admirable narrative of Plutarch. I should be afraid of
spoiling it by abridging it. In it we see that Brutus felt
intense sorrow on learning that Cicero had perished. He
regretted more than a friend that with him he had
lost a cherished hope, which he had been unwilling to
surrender. This time, however, he was bound to acknowledge
that there were no longer citizens at Rome, and to
despair of that base populace who thus allowed its defenders
to perish. “If they are slaves,” said he sadly, “it is their
own fault rather than that of their tyrants.” No confession
could have cost him more. Since he had killed Caesar, his
life had been nothing but a series of disappointments, and
events seemed to play with all the plans he had formed.
His scruples about legality had caused him to lose the
opportunity of saving the republic; his horror of civil war
had only served to make him begin it too late. It was not
enough that he found himself forced, in spite of himself, to
violate the law and fight against his fellow-citizens, he was
constrained to acknowledge, to his great regret, that in
expecting too much of men he was mistaken. He had a
good opinion of them when he studied them from a distance
with his beloved philosophers. His opinions changed when
he came to deal closely with them, when he had to be
a witness of the debasement of character, to detect the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>secret greed, the senseless hatreds, the cowardly fears of
those whom he regarded as the bravest and most honest!
He was so deeply grieved that, on learning of the last
weaknesses of Cicero, he came to doubt of philosophy
itself, his favourite science, which had been the delight of
his life. “Of what use has it been to him,” said he, “to
have written with so much eloquence for the liberty of his
country, upon honour, death, exile, or poverty? In truth, I
begin to have no more confidence in those studies in which
Cicero was so much occupied.”<a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c013'><sup>[374]</sup></a> In reading these bitter
words, we think of those which he spoke before his death;
the one explains the other, and each is a symptom of the same
internal trouble, which becomes great in proportion as the
experience of public affairs disenchants him more and more
with men and with life. He hesitated about philosophy,
when he saw the weakness of those who had studied it
most deeply; when he saw the party of the proscribers
triumphing, he doubted of virtue.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was fitting that thus should perish this man of thought,
who had reluctantly become a man of action, and who was
thrown by the force of events out of his natural element.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE POLITICAL TESTAMENT OF AUGUSTUS</h3>

<p class='c015'>Cicero liked young men; he willingly frequented their
society and readily became young again with them. Just
after he had been praetor and consul, we see him surrounding
himself with promising young men like Caelius, Curio,
and Brutus, whom he took with him to the Forum and
taught to plead at his side. Later, when the defeat of
Pharsalia had removed him from the government of his
country, he began to live familiarly with those light-hearted
young men who had followed the party of the conqueror,
and even consented, as a pastime, to give them lessons in
oratory. “They are my pupils in the art of speaking well,”
he merrily wrote, “and my masters in the art of dining
well.”<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c013'><sup>[375]</sup></a> After the death of Caesar events brought him into
connection with a still younger generation, which then
began to appear in political life. Plancus, Pollio, Messala,
whom fate destined to become high dignitaries of a new
government, sought his friendship, and the founder of the
empire called him father.</p>

<p class='c014'>The correspondence of Octavius and Cicero was published,
and we know that it formed at least three books. It would
have been very interesting had it been preserved. In reading
it we might follow all the phases of that friendship of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>a few months which was to end in such a terrible manner.
Probably the earlier letters of Cicero would show him distrustful
at first, doubtful and coldly polite. Notwithstanding
what has been said, it was not he who called Octavius
to the help of the republic. Octavius came of his own
accord. He wrote to Cicero every day;<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c013'><sup>[376]</sup></a> he overwhelmed
him with protestations and promises, he assured him of a
devotion that could not fail. Cicero hesitated for a long
time to put this devotion to the proof. He thought
Octavius was intelligent and resolute, but rather young.
He dreaded his name and his friends. “He has too many
bad men around him,” said he, “he will never be a good
citizen.”<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c013'><sup>[377]</sup></a> Nevertheless he allowed himself to be gained
over; he forgot his mistrust, and when the <em>boy</em>, as he
affected to call him, had raised the siege of Modena, his
gratitude was carried to an excess that the prudent Atticus
disapproved, and which displeased Brutus. The joy that
he felt at the defeat of Antony made him forget all restraint;
he was blinded and carried away by his hatred. When he
saw “that drunkard fall into the snares of Octavius, on
coming from his debauches,”<a id='r378'></a><a href='#f378' class='c013'><sup>[378]</sup></a> he was beside himself. But
this joy did not last long, for he learnt of the treason of the
general almost at the same time as of his victory. It is at
this moment above all that his letters would become
interesting. They would throw a light on the last months
of his life, the history of which we do not know well. The
efforts that he then made to soften his old friend have been
imputed to him as a crime, and I admit that, consulting
only his dignity, it would have been better not to have
asked anything from him who had so basely betrayed him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>But it was not a question of himself alone. Rome had no
soldiers to oppose to those of Octavius. The sole resource
that remained in order to disarm him, was to remind him
of the promises he had made. No hope remained of
success in reviving any sparks of patriotism in that selfish
mind; but the attempt at least should be made. The republic
was in danger as well as the life of Cicero, and
what it was not proper for him to do to prolong his
own life, it was necessary to attempt in order to save the
republic. Supplication is not base when a man defends
the liberty of his country, and there is no other way of
defending it. It was, no doubt, at this terrible moment
that he wrote those very humble words to Octavius that
we find in the fragments of his letters: “Let me know for
the future what you wish me to do, I shall exceed your
expectation.”<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c013'><sup>[379]</sup></a> Far from reproaching him for his entreaties,
I admit that I cannot see without emotion this glorious old
man humble himself thus before <em>the boy</em> who had betrayed
his confidence, who had played with his credulity, but who
has the power to save or destroy the republic!</p>

<p class='c014'>Unfortunately there only remain fragments of these letters,
which can teach us nothing. If we wish to know him
who held so great a place in the last events of Cicero’s
life we must look elsewhere. It would be easy and instructive
to reproduce here the opinions that the historians
of the empire give of him. But I prefer to keep to the
method that I have followed in this work to the end,
and if it is possible, to judge Octavius, like Cicero, by
what he tells us himself, by his admissions and his confidences.
In the absence of his correspondence and memoirs
which are lost, let us take the great inscription at Ancyra,
which is sometimes called the political testament of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Augustus, because he sums up his whole life in it. Fortunately
it has come down to us. We know from Suetonius
that he had ordered it to be engraven on brass plates fixed
on his tomb.<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c013'><sup>[380]</sup></a> It is probable that it was very widely diffused
in the first century of the Christian era, and that flattery
or gratitude had multiplied copies everywhere, at the same
time that the worship of the founder of the empire extended
throughout the universe. Fragments have been found
among the ruins of Apollonia, and it still exists entire at
Angora, the ancient Ancyra. When the inhabitants of
Ancyra erected a temple to Augustus, who had been their
benefactor, they thought they could not honour his memory
better than by engraving this account, or rather this
glorification of his life that he had himself composed.
Since that time, the monument consecrated to Augustus
has more than once changed its destination; to the Greek
temple a Byzantine church succeeded, and to the church a
Turkish school. The roof has fallen in, dragging with it the
ornaments of the summit, the columns of the porticoes
have disappeared, and to the ancient ruins has been added
the rubbish of the Byzantine and Turkish buildings, which
are already also in ruins. But by singular good fortune the
slabs of marble which recount the actions of Augustus have
remained solidly attached to the indestructible walls.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is a favourable opportunity for studying this monument.
M. Perrot<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c013'><sup>[381]</sup></a> has just brought from Galatia a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>correct copy of the Latin text, and an altogether new part
of the Greek translation which elucidates and completes the
Latin. Thanks to him, with the exception of a few lacunae
of little importance, the inscription is now complete, and
can be read from beginning to end. We can therefore now
perceive and interpret its general sense.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>
  <h4 class='c011'>I.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The first characteristic that we notice when we read the
Ancyran inscription, is its majestic tone. It is impossible
not to be struck by it. We see at once, by a certain air of
authority, that the man who is speaking has governed the
whole world for more than fifty years. He knows the
importance of the things he has done: he knows that he
has introduced a new state of society, and presided over
one of the greatest changes of human history. Accordingly,
although he only recapitulates facts and quotes figures, all
he says has a grand air, and he knows how to give so
majestic a turn to these dry enumerations that we feel
ourselves seized by a sort of involuntary respect in reading
them. We must, however, be on our guard. A majestic
tone may be a convenient veil to hide many weaknesses;
the example of Louis XIV., so near to our own times, ought
to teach us not to trust it without examination. We must
not forget, besides, that dignity was so truly a Roman
characteristic, that its appearance was preserved long after
the reality had disappeared. When we read the inscriptions
of the latter years of the empire we scarcely perceive that
it is about to perish. Those wretched princes who possessed
but a few provinces speak as though they ruled over the
entire universe, and their grossest falsehoods are expressed
with an incredible dignity. If we wish, then, to avoid being
deceived when studying the monuments of Roman history,
we must be on our guard against a first impression, which
may be deceptive, and look at things closely.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although the inscription that we are studying is called
“An account of the deeds of Augustus,” it was not really
his whole life that Augustus meant to relate. There are
great and intentional lacunae; he did not intend to tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>everything. When, at the age of seventy-six, and in the
midst of the admiration and respect of the whole world, the
aged prince reviewed his past life to make a rapid summary
of it, many memories must have disturbed him. There is
no doubt, for instance, that he must have been very reluctant
to recall the earlier years of his political life. It
was needful, however, to say something about them, and it
was more prudent to try and gloss them over than to preserve
a silence that might give rise to much talk. He
extricated himself in the following manner: “At nineteen
years of age,” he says, “I raised an army by my own exertions
and at my own expense; with it I restored liberty to the
republic, which had been dominated by a faction that
oppressed it. In return, the senate, by its decrees, admitted
me into its number, among the consulars, conferred upon
me the right of commanding the troops, and charged me
together with the consuls C. Pansa and A. Hirtius to watch
over the safety of the state with the title of pro-praetor.
Both the consuls having died the same year, the people put
me in their place, and appointed me triumvir to put in
order the republic.” In these few lines, which form the
beginning of the inscription, there are already some very
singular omissions. One would infer from them that he
had obtained all the dignities that he enumerates, in serving
the same cause, and that nothing had happened between
the first offices that he had received and the triumvirate.
Thanks to the <em>Philippics</em> we know those decrees of the
senate which are here alluded to with a certain shamelessness.
The senate congratulates the young Caesar “for
defending the liberty of the Roman people,” and for having
defeated Antony; now, it was after having concerted with
Antony to enslave the Roman people, in that dismal interview
at Bologna, that he received, or rather took the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>title of triumvir. The inscription preserves a prudent
silence on all these things.</p>

<p class='c014'>What followed this interview was still more difficult to
relate. Here especially Augustus desired forgetfulness. “I
exiled those who had killed my father, punishing their crime
by the regular tribunals. Then, as they made war against
the republic, I conquered them in two battles.” It will be
remarked that there is no mention of the proscriptions.
What, indeed, could he say about them? Could any artifice
of language diminish their horror? On the whole it
was more becoming not to speak of them. But as, according
to the fine reflection of Tacitus, it is easier to keep
silence than to forget, we may be assured that Augustus,
who says nothing here of the proscriptions, thought of
them more than once during his life. Even if he did not
feel remorse, he must often have been embarrassed by the
terrible contradiction between his past and his later policy;
for, whatever he might do, the memory of the proscriptions
always belied his official character as a clement and honourable
man. Even here, it seems to me, he betrays his embarrassment.
His silence does not entirely satisfy him, he
feels that in spite of his discretion unpleasant memories
cannot fail to be awakened in the minds of his readers;
and, therefore, to anticipate and disarm them, he hastens to
add: “I carried my arms by land and sea over the whole
world in my wars against the citizens and foreigners. After
my victory, I pardoned the citizens who had survived the
combat, and I chose to preserve rather than to destroy those
foreign nations whom I could spare without danger.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This difficult place once passed it became easier to relate
the rest. Nevertheless, he is still very brief with respect to the
earlier times. Perhaps he feared lest the memory of the civil
wars should interfere with that reconciliation of parties which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>the universal exhaustion had brought about after Actium?
There is certainly not a single word in the whole inscription
to revive the former rancours. He says scarcely anything
of his old rivals. There is at the most but a single
disdainful word about Lepidus, and an ill-natured but passing
accusation against Antony of having seized the treasures
of the temples. The following is all he says of his war with
Sextus Pompey which gave him so much trouble, and of
those valiant seamen who had vanquished him: “I cleared
the sea of pirates, and in that war I captured thirty thousand
fugitive slaves, who had fought against the republic, and delivered
them to their masters to be chastised.” As to that
great victory of Actium, which had given him the empire of
the world, he only recalls it to state the eagerness of Italy
and the western provinces to declare themselves in his
favour.</p>

<p class='c014'>Naturally he prefers to dwell upon the events of the later
years of his reign, and we feel that he is more at ease when
he speaks of victories in which the vanquished were not
Romans. He is justly proud to recall how he had avenged
the insults the national pride had suffered before him: “I
re-took, after victories gained in Spain and over the Dalmatians,
the standards that some generals had lost. I forced
the Parthians to restore the spoils and ensigns of three
Roman armies, and humbly to come and demand our friendship.
I placed these ensigns in the sanctuary of Mars the
Avenger.” We can understand also that he speaks with
satisfaction of the campaigns against the Germans, being
careful, however, to pass over in silence the disaster of
Varus, and that he is anxious to preserve the memory of
those distant expeditions that impressed so strongly the
imagination of his contemporaries. “The Roman fleet,”
he says, “sailed from the mouth of the Rhine towards the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>quarter where the sun rises, as far as those distant countries
where no Roman had yet penetrated either by land or sea.
The Cimbri, the Charydes, the Semnones and other German
tribes of those countries sent ambassadors to ask my friendship
and that of the Roman people. Under my orders and
direction two armies were sent almost at the same time to
Arabia and Ethiopia. After having conquered many nations,
and taken many prisoners, they reached the city of Nabata,
in Ethiopia, and the boundaries of the Sabaeans and the
city of Mariba, in Arabia.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But whatever interest we may find in these historical recollections,
the interest of the Ancyra monument does not
specially lie in them. Its real importance consists in what
it tells us of the internal government of Augustus.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here again we must read with caution. Politicians are
very seldom in the habit of posting up on the walls of
temples the principles that guide them, and of imparting the
secrets of their conduct so generously to the public. It is
evident that Augustus, who wrote here for all the world, did
not intend to tell everything, and that if we wish to learn
the exact truth, and to know thoroughly the character of his
institutions, we must look elsewhere. The historian, Dio
Cassius, gives us the most complete information on this
subject. Dio is very little read, and it is not surprising, for
he has none of the qualities that attract readers. His narrative
is constantly interrupted by interminable harangues, which
repel the most patient reader. He was a man of narrow
mind, without political capacity, taken up with ridiculous
superstitions, and he attributes the same characteristics to his
historical personages. Truly it was worth while to have been
twice consul in order to tell us seriously that, after a great
defeat, Octavius took courage on seeing a fish leap out of the
sea to his feet! What adds to the annoyance he gives us is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>that as he has often treated of the same subjects as Tacitus,
he constantly suggests comparisons that are unflattering to
himself. We must, however, take care not to underrate
him; tedious as he is, he renders us very useful services. If
he has not the broad views of Tacitus, he devotes himself to
details and does wonders. No one has ever been more exact
and minute than he. I think of him as a zealous government
official who has passed through all the grades and grown old
in his profession. He knows thoroughly that official and
administrative world in which he has lived; he speaks of it
accurately, and loves to speak of it. With these inclinations,
it is natural that he should be interested in the reforms introduced
by Augustus into the internal government of the
empire. He is anxious to let us know them in detail; and,
true to his rhetorician’s habits and to his unbridled love for
fine speeches, he assumes that it was Maecenas who proposed
to Augustus to establish them, and he takes advantage
of the opportunity to make him speak at great length.<a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c013'><sup>[382]</sup></a> The
discourse of Maecenas contains, in truth, what we may call
the general theory of the empire. This interesting sketch,
which was realized later, aids us greatly in understanding
that part which we have still to examine of the inscription of
Ancyra. We should always bear it in mind in order to apprehend
thoroughly the spirit of the institutions of Augustus, the
motive of his liberalities, the hidden meaning of the facts he
mentions, and above all the character of his relations with
the different classes of citizens.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us begin by studying the relations of Augustus with
his soldiers. “About&#160;... thousand Romans,”<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c013'><sup>[383]</sup></a> says he,
“bore arms under me. I established in colonies, or sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>back to their municipia after their term of service, rather
more than three hundred thousand. I gave land, or money
to buy it, to all of them.” On two different occasions, after
the wars against Sextus Pompey, and against Antony,
Augustus was at the head of about fifty legions; he had
only twenty-five when he died. But this number, reduced
as it was, still weighed intolerably upon the finances of the
empire. The immense increase of expenditure that the
creation of great standing armies threw upon the treasury
prevented Augustus for a long time, notwithstanding the
prosperity of his reign, from having what we should now call
a budget in equilibrium. Four times he was obliged to aid
the public treasury from his private fortune, and he reckons
the amounts that he presented to the state at one hundred
and fifty million sesterces (£1,200,000). He had much
trouble to remedy these financial difficulties, of which the
expenses of the army were the principal cause. This gave
him the idea of creating a sort of military pension fund, and
of appealing, in order to fill it, to the generosity of the allied
kings and cities, and of the richest Roman citizens; and in
order to stimulate others by his own example, he gave one
hundred and seventy million sesterces (£1,360,000) at one
time. But these voluntary gifts being insufficient it was
necessary to impose new taxes, and to fill the treasury of
the army with the proceeds of a tax of a twentieth on
inheritances and a hundredth on sales. Yet it seems that,
notwithstanding these efforts, pensions were ill paid, since
this was one of the grievances that the legions of Pannonia
alleged in their revolt against Tiberius. It is certain that
the army of Augustus was one of the greatest anxieties of
his administration. His own legions gave him as much
trouble as those of the enemy. He had to do with soldiers
who felt that they were the masters, and who for ten years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>had been corrupted by flattery and promises. On the eve
of battle they were very exacting because they knew how
much they were required; after victory they became unmanageable
from the pride with which it inspired them. In
order to satisfy them, it would have been necessary to
expropriate all the inhabitants of Italy in a body. Octavius
had consented to this at first, after Philippi; but later, when
his policy changed, when he understood that he could not
found a stable government if he drew on himself the hatred
of the Italians, he resolved to pay the proprietors handsomely
for the lands that he gave his veterans. “I reimbursed
the municipia,” he says, “in money, the value of
the lands that I gave to my soldiers in my fourth consulship,
and later under the consulship of M. Crassus and Cn.
Lentulus. I paid six hundred million sesterces (£4,800,000)
for the lands situated in Italy, and two hundred and sixty
million sesterces (£2,080,000) for those situated in the provinces.
Of all those who have established colonies of soldiers
in the provinces and in Italy, I am, up to now, the first and
only one who has acted thus.” He was right in boasting of it.
It was not at all the habit of the generals of that time to pay
for what they took, and he himself had given another example
for a long time. When, a little later, he dared to resist the
demands of his veterans, he had to maintain terrible struggles
in which his life was more than once in danger. In every way,
his demeanour towards his soldiers at that time is one of the
things that do him most honour. He owed everything to
them, and he had none of the qualities which were necessary
to master them, neither the abilities of Caesar nor the
defects of Antony; and yet he dared to make head against
them, and succeeded in obtaining the mastery. It is very
remarkable that, although he had gained his power solely by
war, he was able to maintain the predominance of the civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>element in the government that he founded. If the empire,
in which there was no longer any other element of strength
and life than the army, did not become from that period a
military monarchy, it is assuredly owing to his firmness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nothing is more simple than the relations of Augustus
with the people. The information that the Ancyra inscription
furnishes upon this subject is quite in accord with the
discourse of Maecenas: he fed them and amused them.
Here, to begin with, is the exact account of the sums he expended
to feed them: “I reckoned to the Roman people
three hundred sesterces (£2 8<em>s.</em>) a head according to my
father’s testament, and four hundred sesterces (£3 4<em>s.</em>) in
my own name, out of the spoils of the war during my fifth
consulship. Another time, in my tenth consulship, I gave a
gratuity of four hundred sesterces to each citizen, from my
private fortune. During my eleventh consulship I made
twelve distributions of corn at my own cost. When I was
invested for the twelfth time with the tribunitian power, I
again gave four hundred sesterces a head to the people.
All these distributions were made to no fewer than two
hundred and fifty thousand persons. Invested for the eighteenth
time with the tribunitian power, and consul for the
twelfth, I gave sixty denarii (£1 10<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>) a head to
three hundred and twenty thousand inhabitants of Rome.
During my fourth consulship I had one thousand sesterces
(£8) for each of my soldiers, previously deducted from
the spoil, and distributed in the colonies formed by them.
About one hundred and twenty thousand colonists received
their share in the distribution that followed my triumph.
Consul for the thirteenth time, I gave sixty denarii to each
of those who then received distributions of corn; there
were rather more than two hundred thousand.” After these
truly startling liberalities Augustus mentions the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>games he gave to the people, and although the text has
several lacunae here, we may suppose that it did not cost
him less to amuse the people than to feed them. “I gave
shows of gladiators<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c013'><sup>[384]</sup></a>&#160;... times in my own name, and five
times in the names of my children or grandchildren. In
these different <i><span lang="fr">fêtes</span></i> about ten thousand men fought. Twice
in my own name, and three times in the names of my son
and grandson, I had combats of wrestlers whom I had brought
from all countries. I celebrated public games four times in
my own name, and twenty-three times in place of magistrates
who were absent or could not support the expense of these
games.... I showed twenty-six times in my own name, or
in the names of my sons and grandsons, African wild beast
hunts, in the circus, on the Forum, or in the amphitheatres,
and about three thousand five hundred of these beasts were
killed. I gave the people the spectacle of a naval combat,
beyond the Tiber, where the wood of the Caesars now is.
I had a canal dug there one thousand eight hundred feet
long by one thousand two hundred feet broad. There thirty
ships armed with rams, triremes, biremes, and a large number
of smaller vessels fought together. These vessels contained,
besides their rowers, a crew of three thousand men.” Here,
as it seems to me, is a curious and official commentary on
the famous expression of Juvenal, <i><span lang="la">panem et circenses</span></i>. We
see clearly that it was not a sally of the poet, but a veritable
principle of policy happily invented by Augustus that his
successors preserved as a tradition of government.</p>

<p class='c014'>The relations of Augustus with the senate, we can well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>understand, were more difficult and complicated. Even
after Pharsalia and Philippi it was still a great name that it
was necessary to treat with consideration. Depressed as it
was, the old aristocracy still caused some fear, and seemed
to deserve some regard. This is well seen by the care that
Augustus takes in his testament never to speak of the senate
but with respect. Its name comes up at every turn with a
sort of affectation. We should say indeed, if we trusted
to appearances, that the senate was then the master, and
that the prince was contented to execute its decrees. This
is what Augustus wished to be believed. He passed all his
life in dissembling his authority or lamenting about it. From
his royal dwelling on the Palatine he wrote the most
pathetic letters to the senate asking to be relieved of the
burden of public affairs, and he never appeared to have a
greater aversion for power than at the moment when he was
concentrating all powers in his own hands. It is not extraordinary
that we find these methods again in his testament:
they had succeeded too well with his contemporaries
for him not to be tempted to make use of them with posterity.
Accordingly he continues to play the same comedy of moderation
and disinterestedness. He affects, for instance, to insist
as much upon the honours that he refused as upon those
that he accepted. “During the consulship of M. Marcellus
and L. Arruntius,” he says, “when the senate and people asked
me to accept an absolute authority,<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c013'><sup>[385]</sup></a> I did not accept it. But
I did not refuse to undertake the supervision of supplies in
a great famine, and by the expenditure that I made I delivered
the people from their fears and dangers. When,
in return, they offered me the consulship annually or for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>life, I refused it.” This is not the only time that he dwells
on his own moderation. More than once again he refers to
dignities or presents that he would not accept. But here,
indeed, is something that passes all bounds; “In my sixth
and seventh consulship, after having suppressed the civil
wars, when the common voice of all the citizens offered
me the supreme power, I restored the government of the
republic to the senate and people. As a recompense for
this action I received the title of Augustus by a decree of
the senate, my door was encircled with laurels and surmounted
by a civic crown, and a golden shield was placed
in the Julian curia with an inscription recording that this
honour was awarded me as a mark of respect to my virtue,
clemency, justice, and piety. From this moment, although
I was above the rest in dignity in the offices with which I
was invested, I never claimed more power than I allowed to
my colleagues.” This curious passage shows how inscriptions
may deceive if we trust them blindly. Would it not
seem that we should be right in concluding that in the year
of Rome 726, the republic had been re-established by the
generosity of Augustus? Now it was exactly at this period
that the absolute power of the emperor was delivered from
all fear of attack from without and, being quietly accepted
by everybody, was finally established. Dio himself, the
official Dio, who is so ready to take the word of the emperor,
cannot accept this falsehood of Augustus; he ventures
to show that he is not deceived, and has no difficulty in
proving that this government, under whatever name it is
disguised, was at bottom a monarchy; he might have added
that there was never a more absolute monarchy. A single
man constituted himself the heir of all the magistrates of the
republic, and united all their powers in himself. He ignored
the people whom he no longer consulted; he is the master
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>of the senate, which he chooses and forms at will; at once
consul and pontif, he regulates actions and beliefs; invested
with the tribunitian power, he is inviolable and sacred, that
is to say, that the least word let fall against him becomes a
sacrilege; as censor, under the title of praefect of morals, he
can control the conduct of private persons, and interfere,
when he likes, in the most private affairs of life.<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c013'><sup>[386]</sup></a> Everything
is subordinated to him, private as well as public life,
and his authority can penetrate everywhere from the senate
to the most humble and obscure hearths. Add to this
that the boundaries of his empire are those of the civilized
world; barbarism begins where slavery ends, and there is
not even the sad resource of exile against this despotism.
Yet it is the man who possesses this appalling power, whom
nothing in his immense empire escapes, and from whose
empire it is impossible to escape, it is he who has just told
us with a bare-faced assurance that he refused to accept
absolute power!</p>

<p class='c014'>It must be acknowledged that this absolute power, which
he veiled with so much precaution, sought also by every
possible means to reconcile men to itself. All the compensations
which might make a people forget its liberty
were given to the Romans by Augustus with a free hand.
I do not speak only of that material prosperity which made
the number of citizens increase by nearly a million in his
reign;<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c013'><sup>[387]</sup></a> nor even of the repose and security which, at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>close of the civil war, was the most imperious need of the
whole world, but also of that incomparable splendour with
which he adorned Rome. This was a sure means of pleasing
the people. Caesar knew this well, and had expended one
hundred million sesterces (£800,000) at one time, simply
in buying the ground on which his Forum was to stand.
Augustus did still more. The Ancyra inscription contains
a list of the public buildings he constructed, but it is so
long that it is impossible to quote it all. He mentions fifteen
temples, several porticoes, a theatre, a senate house, a Forum,
a basilica, aqueducts, public roads, etc.; in truth Rome
was entirely reconstructed by him. We may say that no
public building was passed over by him, and that he restored
all those that he did not rebuild. He completed Pompey’s
theatre and the Forum of Caesar, and rebuilt the Capitol;
in a single year he repaired eighty-two temples that were
falling into ruin. He did not expend so many millions
without a purpose, and all this profusion in such a careful
ruler covered a profound political design. He wished to
dazzle the people, to intoxicate them with luxury and
magnificence in order to divert them from the intrusive
memories of the past. That Rome of marble that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>built was intended to make them forget the Rome of
brick.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was not the only compensation that Augustus offered
to the people; he made them nobler amends, and thus
sought to legitimatize his power. If he demanded the
sacrifice of their liberty he took care to gratify their national
pride in every way. No man compelled the respect of
foreign nations for Rome more than he; no man gave her
more reason for pride in the ascendency she enjoyed among
her neighbours. The latter part of the inscription is filled
with the gratifying recital of the marks of respect that the
remotest countries of the world paid to Rome under his
reign. He was eager to direct their attention towards this
external glory, lest they should fix it with some regret on
what was taking place at home. Those citizens whom the
aspect of the deserted Forum and the obedient senate
depressed, he pointed to the Roman armies penetrating
among the Pannonians and the Arabs, to the Roman fleets
navigating the Rhine and the Danube, to the kings of the
Britons, the Suevi, and the Marcomanni, refugees at Rome,
imploring the support of the legions, to the Medes and
Parthians, those terrible enemies of Rome, who asked of
her a king, to the most distant nations, the least known and
the best protected by their distance and their obscurity,
moved by this great name that reaches them for the first
time and soliciting the Roman alliance. “Ambassadors
came to me from India, from kings who had never yet sent
to any Roman general. The Bastarnae, the Scythians,
and the Sarmatians who dwell on this side the Tanaïs,
and beyond that river, the kings of the Albanians, the
Hiberi and the Medes sent ambassadors to me asking our
friendship.” It was very difficult for the most discontented
to hold out against so much grandeur. But his greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>master-stroke was that he extended this consideration for
the glory of Rome even to the past. He honoured all who
had laboured for her at all times, says Suetonius,<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c013'><sup>[388]</sup></a> almost as
much as the gods; and to show that none was excluded
from this veneration, he raised again the statue of Pompey,
at the base of which Caesar had fallen, and set it up in a
public place. This generous conduct was also a wise policy.
By claiming a share in the glories of the past, he disarmed,
by anticipation, those men who might be tempted to use
them against him, and, at the same time, gave a species of
sanction to his authority by attaching it in some sort to
these old memories. Whatever difference might distinguish
the government that he founded from that of the republic,
both agreed on one point: they sought the greatness of
Rome. Augustus tried to reconcile the past with the
present on this common ground. He also had adorned
Rome, defended her frontiers, extended her empire, and
made her name respected. He had continued and completed
that work on which they had laboured for seven
centuries. He might, then, call himself the continuator
and heir of all those who had set their hand to it; of Cato,
Paulus Emilius, and Scipio, and rank himself among them.
He did not fail to do so when he built the Forum that bore
his name; we know from Suetonius that, under those
porticoes raised by him and filled with the records of his
actions, he ranged all the great men of the republic in
triumphal costume. This was the highest point of his
political skill, for by connecting them with his glory he
received in turn a share of theirs, and thus turned to his
own advantage the greatness of the political order which he
had overturned.</p>

<p class='c014'>These compensations that Augustus offered to the Romans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>in exchange for their liberty seem to have satisfied them.
Every one quickly got accustomed to the new government,
and it may be said that Augustus reigned without opposition.
The plots which more than once threatened his life were
the crimes of a few isolated malcontents, of young thoughtless
fellows whom he had disgraced, or of vulgar and
ambitious men who desired his position; they were not the
work of political parties. Can it even be said that there
were any political parties at this moment? Those of Sextus
Pompey and Antony had not survived the death of their
chiefs; and, since Philippi, there were scarcely any republicans.
From that moment all wise men adopted the maxim
“that the vast body of the empire could not stand upright
and stable without some one to direct it.” A few obstinate
men alone, who were not yet converted, wrote violent
declamations in the schools under the name of Erutus and
Cicero, or allowed themselves to speak freely in those polite
gatherings which were the <i><span lang="fr">salons</span></i> of that time: <i><span lang="la">in conviviis
rodunt</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">in circulis vellicant</span></i>. But those were unimportant
exceptions which disappeared in the midst of the universal
admiration and respect. During more than fifty years the
senate, the knights, and the people used all their ingenuity
to find new honours for him who had given Rome internal
peace, and who maintained her grandeur so vigorously
abroad. Augustus has been careful to recall all this
homage in the inscription we are studying, not in a fit
of puerile vanity, but to represent that agreement of all
orders in the state which seemed to legitimatize his
authority. This idea is shown especially in the last lines
of the inscription, where he recalls that circumstance of his
life which was most dear to him, because in it the agreement
of all citizens had most strikingly appeared: “While
I was consul for the thirteenth time, the senate, the order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>of knights, and all the people gave me the name of Father
of our Country, and desired that this should be inscribed in
the vestibule of my house, in the curia, and in my Forum,
below the quadrigae which had been placed there in my
honour by a decree of the senate. When I wrote these
things I was in my seventy-sixth year.” It was not without
reason that he reserved this detail for the end. This title
of Father of his Country, by which he was saluted in the
name of all the citizens by Messala, the old friend of Brutus,
seemed to be the legal consecration of a power acquired by
illegal means and a sort of amnesty that Rome accorded
to the past. We can well understand that Augustus, even
when dying, dwelt with satisfaction on a recollection which
seemed like an absolution, and that he was anxious to
terminate in this fashion his review of his political life.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>II.</h4>

<p class='c015'>I should like to give, in a few words, the impression that
the analysis of this remarkable inscription makes upon me
as to its author.</p>

<p class='c014'>The whole political life of Augustus is contained in two
official documents which, by singular good fortune, have
both come down to us; I mean the preamble of the edict
of proscription that Octavius signed, and, according to all
appearance, drew up himself, which Appian has preserved;
and the inscription found on the walls of the temple of
Ancyra. The former shows us what Octavius was at
twenty, fresh from the hands of the rhetoricians and
philosophers, with all the genuine instincts of his nature; the
latter, what he became after fifty-six years of uncontrolled
and unlimited power; it is sufficient to compare them in
order to discover the road he had traversed, and the changes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>that the knowledge of men and the practice of public affairs
had wrought in him.</p>

<p class='c014'>The possession of power had made him better, a thing
which is not usual, and after him Roman history only gives
us examples of princes depraved by power. From the
battle of Philippi to that of Actium, or rather to the moment
when he seems formally to ask pardon of the world by
abolishing all the acts of the triumvirate, we feel that he is
striving to become better, and we can almost follow the
steps of his progress. I do not think that we could find
another example of so strong an effort at self-conquest, and
so complete a success in overcoming one’s natural disposition.
He was naturally a coward, and hid himself in his
tent in his first battle. I know not how he did it, but he
succeeded in acquiring courage; he became inured to war
in fighting against Sextus Pompey, and even courageous in
the expedition against the Dalmatians, in which he was
twice wounded. He was cynical and debauched, and the
orgies of his youth, as related by Suetonius, do not yield to
Antony’s; yet he corrected himself at the very moment
that he became absolute master, that is just when his
passions would have met with the fewest obstacles. He
was naturally cruel, and coldly cruel, a disposition which
does not often change; and yet, after having begun by
assassinating his benefactors, he ended by sparing those
who attempted his assassination, and the philosopher Seneca
could call the same man a clement prince<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c013'><sup>[389]</sup></a> whom his best
friend, Maecenas, had once called a common executioner.
Certainly the man who signed the edict of proscription hardly
seems to be the same as the man who wrote the testament,
and it is indeed matter for wonder that a man who began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>as he did was able to change so completely, and to assume
a virtuous character, or the appearance of one, in the place
of all the vices that were natural to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nevertheless we should find it difficult to love him,
whatever justice we are bound to do him. We may be
wrong after all; for reason tells us that we ought to
appreciate people more for the qualities they acquire by
thus triumphing over themselves than for those they have
by nature, without taking any trouble. And yet, I hardly
know why, it is only the latter that please us; the former
lack a certain charm that nature alone gives and which
wins our hearts. The effort is too apparent in them, and
behind the effort some personal interest; for we always
suspect that a man has taken so much pains only because
there was some advantage to be gained. This sort of
acquired goodness, in which reason has a greater share than
nature, attracts no one, because it appears to be the product
of a calculating mind, and it is this feeling that causes all
the virtues of Augustus to leave us unmoved, and to seem
at the most but the results of a profound sagacity. They
want a touch of nature and simplicity in order to affect us.
These are qualities that this stiff and formal personage never
knew, although according to Suetonius he gladly assumed
an appearance of plain manners and good-nature in his
familiar intercourse. But one is not a good fellow simply
through wishing to be it, and his private letters, of which
we have a few fragments, show that his pleasantries lacked
ease, and that his simplicity was the result of effort. Do
we not know, besides, from Suetonius himself, that he wrote
down what he meant to say to his friends, in order to leave
nothing to chance, and that he even occasionally wrote
down his conversations with Livia beforehand?<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c013'><sup>[390]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>But, after all, that which spoils Augustus in our opinion
is that he stands so near Caesar; the contrast between
them is complete. Caesar, not to speak of what was really
great and brilliant in his nature, attracts us at once by his
frankness. His ambition may displease us, but he had at
least the merit of not hiding it. I do not know why M.
Mommsen exerts himself in his <cite>Roman History</cite> to prove
that Caesar did not care for the diadem, and that Antony,
when he offered it, had not consulted him. I prefer to
hold to the common opinion which, I think, does not do
him wrong. He wished to be king, and to bear the title
as well as to exercise the power. He never made pretence
of waiting to be asked to accept honours that he passionately
desired, as Augustus did. He was not the man to
make us believe that he only retained the supreme authority
with reluctance, and would not have dared to tell us, at
the very moment that he was drawing all powers into his
hands, that he had restored the government of the republic
to the people and senate. We know, on the contrary, that
after Pharsalia he said frankly that “the republic” was a
phrase without meaning, and that Sulla was a fool to have
abdicated the dictatorship. In everything, even in questions
of literature and grammar, he was a bold innovator, and
he did not display a hypocritical respect for the past at the
very time that he was destroying what had come down
from it. This frankness is more to our taste than the false
appearance of veneration that Augustus lavished on the
senate after reducing it to impotence; and whatever admiration
Suetonius may express for him, when he shows him to
us, obsequiously saluting each senator by name, before the
sittings commenced, I am not sure that I do not prefer
the disrespectful behaviour of Caesar to this comedy, Caesar
who at last went so far as not to rise when the senate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>visited him. Both appeared weary of power, but it never
came into any one’s mind to think that Augustus was speaking
the truth when he asked so earnestly to be restored to
private life. The distaste of Caesar was deeper and more
sincere. That sovereign power, that he had sought after
for more than twenty years with an indefatigable persistence,
through so many perils, and by means of dark intrigues
the remembrance of which must have made him blush, did
not answer to his expectations, and appeared unsatisfying
to him though he had so eagerly desired it. He knew that
he was detested by the men whose esteem he most desired;
he was constrained to make use of men whom he despised,
and whose excesses dishonoured his victory; the higher
he rose, the more unpleasing did human nature appear to
him, and the more clearly did he see the base greed and
cowardly treachery of those who intrigued at his feet. He
came at last, through disgust, to have no interest in life; it
seemed to him to be no longer worth the trouble of preserving
and defending. It is, therefore, the same man who
said, even at the period when Cicero delivered the <cite><span lang="la">pro
Marcello</span></cite>: “I have lived long enough for nature or for
glory;” who later, when he was pressed to take precautions
against his assassins, answered in a tone of despondency:
“I would rather die at once than live in fear;” who might
well have said with Corneille:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I desired the empire and I have attained to it;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I knew not what it was that I desired:</div>
      <div class='line'>In its possession I have found, instead of delights,</div>
      <div class='line'>Appalling cares, continual alarms,</div>
      <div class='line'>A thousand secret enemies, death at every turn,</div>
      <div class='line'>No pleasure without alloy, and never repose.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>These fine lines please me less, I admit, put into the mouth
of Augustus. This cautious politician, so cold, so self-possessed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>does not seem to me to have really known that
noble sadness that reveals the man in the hero, that
melancholy of a heart ill at ease, notwithstanding its
successes, and disgusted with power through the very
exercise of power. Whatever admiration I may feel for
that fine scene in which Augustus proposes to abdicate the
empire, I cannot avoid being a little vexed with Corneille
that he took so seriously and depicted so gravely that
solemn piece of acting which deceived nobody in Rome,
and when I wish to render my pleasure complete in reading
the tragedy of <em>Cinna</em>, I am always tempted to replace the
character of Augustus by that of Caesar.</p>

<p class='c014'>I add, in conclusion, that all these insincere affectations
of Augustus were not only defects of character, but also
political errors which left most unfortunate effects on the
government that he had created. It was precisely the uncertainty
that the interested falsehoods of Augustus had
thrown upon the real nature and limits of the power of the
earlier Caesars that rendered their tyranny insupportable.
When a government boldly states its principles we know
how to behave towards it; but what course is to be followed,
what language held when the forms of liberty are united with
the reality of despotism, when absolute power hides under
republican fictions? In the midst of this obscurity every
course has danger and threatens ruin. Men are ruined by
independence, they may also be ruined by servility; for, if
he who refuses anything to the emperor is an open enemy
who regrets the republic, may not he who eagerly grants
everything be a secret enemy, who wishes to show that the
republic no longer exists? In studying Tacitus we find
the statesmen of this terrible period moving at random
among these wilfully accumulated uncertainties, stumbling
at every step over unseen dangers, liable to displease if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>they are silent or if they speak, if they flatter or if they
resist, continually asking themselves with dread how they
can satisfy this ambiguous and ill-defined authority whose
limits escape them. This want of sincerity in the institutions
of Augustus may be said to have been the torment of
several generations. All the evil came because Augustus
thought more of the present than of the future. He was
an able man, full of resources in escaping from embarrassing
and difficult situations; he was not in reality a great
politician, for it seems that his view seldom extended
beyond the difficulties of the moment. Placed face to
face with a people who bore the kingship uneasily, and who
were not fit for anything else, he invented this sort of
disguised kingship, and allowed all the forms of the old
government to exist by its side without endeavouring to
conform them to it. But if he was not so great a politician
as it has been pretended, it must be admitted that he was
an excellent administrator; that part of his work deserves
all the praise that has been lavished on it. By co-ordinating
all the wise observances and useful regulations that the
republic had created, by putting in force lost traditions,
by himself creating new institutions for the administration
of Rome, the service of the legions, the handling of the
finances and the government of the provinces, he organized
the empire and thus rendered it capable of resisting
external enemies and internal causes of dissolution. If,
notwithstanding a detestable political system, the general
lowering of character, and the vices of the governors and
the governed, the empire still had a time of prosperity and
lasted three centuries, it owed it to the powerful organization
it had received from Augustus. This was the really vital
part of his work. It is important enough to justify the
testimony that he bears to himself in that haughty phrase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>of the Ancyran inscription: “I made new laws. I restored
to honour the examples of our forefathers which were disappearing
from our manners, and I have myself left
examples worthy of being imitated by our descendants.”</p>

<h4 class='c011'>III.</h4>

<p class='c015'>It was no doubt about the middle of the reign, when he
who was the absolute master of the republic was pretending
to restore the government to the people and senate, that
Cicero’s letters appeared. The exact date of their publication
is unknown; but everything tends to the belief that it
should be placed in the years that followed the battle of
Actium. The power of Augustus, become more popular
since it had become more moderate, felt itself strong enough
to allow some liberty of writing. It was mistrustful before
that time because it was not sufficiently consolidated; it
became so again later when it perceived that public favour
was passing from it. This reign, which began by proscribing
men, ended by burning books. Cicero’s correspondence
could only have been published in the interval that separates
these periods.</p>

<p class='c014'>No one has told us what impression it produced on those
who read it for the first time; but it may be fearlessly
asserted that it was a very lively impression. The civil
wars had only just ended, up till that time men were only
occupied with present ills; in those misfortunes no man’s
mind was sufficiently free to think of the past, but in the
first period of tranquillity which that troubled generation
knew, it hastened to throw a glance backward. Whether
it sought to account for the events that had happened or
wished to enjoy that bitter pleasure which is found, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>to the poet, in the recollections of former sufferings, it
retraced the sad years it had just traversed, and wished to
go back to the very beginning of that struggle whose end it
had seen. Nothing could satisfy their curiosity better than
Cicero’s letters, and it cannot therefore be doubtful that
everybody at that time eagerly read them.</p>

<p class='c014'>I do not think that this reading did any harm to the
government of Augustus. Perhaps the reputation of some
important personages of the new government suffered a little
from it. To have their republican professions of faith disinterred
was unpleasant for men who boasted of being the
private friends of the prince. I suppose that the malicious
must have diverted themselves with those letters in which
Pollio swears to be the eternal enemy of tyrants and in
which Plancus harshly attributes the misfortunes of the
republic to the treason of Octavius, who himself was not
to be spared; and these lively recollections of a time when
he held out his hand to Caesar’s assassins and called Cicero
his father, were not favourable to him. All this provided
subjects of conversation for the malcontents during several
weeks. But upon the whole, the mischief was small, and
these railleries did not endanger the security of the great
empire. What was most to be feared for it was that
imagination, always favourable to the past, should freely
attribute to the republic those qualities with which it is so
easy to adorn institutions that no longer exist. Now,
Cicero’s letters were much more suited to destroy these
illusions than to encourage them. The picture they present
of the intrigues, the disorders, and the scandals of that time
did not permit men to regret it. The men whom Tacitus
depicts to us as worn out with struggles and eager for repose,
found in it nothing that could attract them, and the bad use
that men like Curio, Caelius, and Dolabella had made of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>liberty, rendered them less sensitive to the sorrow of having
lost it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The memory of him who wrote these letters gained most
by their publication. It was very common at that time to
speak ill of Cicero. Notwithstanding the manner in which
the court historians narrated the meeting at Bologna and
the honourable part they attempted to give Octavius in the
proscriptions,<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c013'><sup>[391]</sup></a> they were none the less unpleasant recollections
for him. His victims were calumniated in order to
diminish his faults. This is what Asinius Pollio wished to
do, when he said, in his speech for Lamia, that Cicero died
like a coward.<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c013'><sup>[392]</sup></a> Those whose devotedness did not go so
far, and who had not enough courage to insult him, took
care at least to say nothing of him. It has been remarked
that none of the great poets of this time speak of him, and
we know from Plutarch that at the Palatine it was necessary
to read his works in secret. Silence therefore fell, as far
as it was indeed possible, around Cicero’s great glory; but
the publication of his letters recalled him to the memory
of everybody. When once they had been read, this intellectual
and gentle figure, so amiable, so human and so
attractive even in its weaknesses, could not again be
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c014'>To the interest that the personality of Cicero gives to his
letters, a still more vivid interest is added for us. We have
seen, in what I have just written, how much our time resembles
that of which these letters speak to us. It had no
solid faith any more than our own, and its sad experiences
of revolutions had disgusted it with everything while inuring
it to everything. The men of that time knew, just as we do,
that discontent with the present and that uncertainty of
the morrow which do not allow us to enjoy tranquillity or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>repose. In them we see ourselves; the sorrows of the men
of those times are partly our own, and we have suffered the
same ills of which they complained. We, like them, live in
one of those transitional periods, the most mournful of
history, in which the traditions of the past have disappeared
and the future is not yet clearly defined, and know not on
what to set our affections, and we can well understand that
they might have said with the ancient Hesiod: “Would
that I had died sooner or been born later!” This is what
gives Cicero’s letters so lively though mournful an interest
for us; this is what first attracted me towards them; this
is what, perhaps, will give us some pleasure in spending
a short time in the society of the persons they depict,
who, in spite of the lapse of years, seem almost to be our
contemporaries.</p>

works published in Germany, especially the fine Roman History of
M. Mommsen, so learned and at the same time so living. I do not
always share his opinions, but the influence of his ideas will be perceived
even in passages where I do not agree with him. He is the
master of all who study Rome and her history now.</p>

<p class='c014'><a href='#r33'>33</a>. It has been remarked that, in his <cite>Republic</cite>, Cicero speaks of kingship
with much esteem, and even a sort of emotion which may easily
surprise us in a republican like him; but he understands by it a kind of
primitive and patriarchal government, and he demands so many virtues
in the king and his subjects that we see very well that he does not think
that this royalty was easy or even possible. We cannot therefore admit,
as has been done by some, that Cicero meant to announce beforehand,
and to approve of the revolution that Caesar accomplished some years
later. On the contrary, he indicates in very clear terms what he will
think of Caesar and his government when he attacks those tyrants who,
in their greed for rule, wish to govern alone, in contempt of the rights of
the people. “The tyrants many be clement,” he adds; “but what does
it matter whether we have an indulgent or a barbarous master? One is
none the less a slave with either” (<cite><span lang="la">De Rep.</span></cite> i. 33).</p>

in a clear light in one of the too scanty writings he has published on
Cicero. Speaking of this, we maybe permitted to regret that M. Berger
and he have not given to the public the excellent series of lectures
which they delivered at the Collège de France and at the Sorbonne, of
which Cicero was so often the subject. If they had acceded to the
wishes of their auditors, and the entreaties of all friends of letters,
France would have nothing to envy Germany on this important
question.</p>

only gave them 4 per cent. When he left Rome after the death of
Caesar, Cicero wrote to Atticus that the money that was owing him
would suffice to pay his debts; but as at that moment money was scarce
and debtors held off, he ordered him to sell his goods, if necessary, and
added: “Consult only my reputation.” <cite><span lang="la">Ad Att.</span></cite> xvi. 2.</p>

<p class='c014'><a href='#r180'>180</a>. In the time of the Gracchi, the Censor Metellus thus expressed
himself in a speech in which he vigorously attacked bachelors: “Citizens,
if we could live without wives we should all dispense with that
encumbrance (<i><span lang="la">omnes ea molestia careremus</span></i>); but, as nature has willed
it to be as impossible to do without them as it is disagreeable to live
with them, let us sacrifice the charms of so short a life to the interests
of the republic, which must always endure.” This way of encouraging
men to marry seemed apparently very efficacious, since, at the time
when men married less than ever, Augustus thought he ought to have
the speech of old Metellus read to the people.</p>

very fine letter of his on the death of Caesar remains (<cite><span lang="la">Ad fam.</span></cite> xi. 28).
He was a true friend of Caesar; but it is to be remarked that he was
not one of those whom he made praetors and consuls, and whose
debts he had often paid. Matius never filled any important political
office, and his name would not have come down to us if it had not been
for Cicero’s correspondence.</p>

retained his levity of character and bantering humour in the midst of
these grave affairs in which he staked his life. After his curule chair
had been broken he had another made entirely of leather thongs, and
took it to the consul. All the spectators burst out laughing. The

<p class='c014'><a href='#r306'>306</a>. It is not easy to say what Caesar’s projects were, as his work was
interrupted by his death. Some insist that he only desired a sort of
dictatorship for life; the greater number suppose that he thought of
permanently establishing monarchical rule. The question is too grave to
be entered upon incidentally, and settled in a few words. I will simply
say that perhaps he only thought at first of the dictatorship; but in proportion
as he became more powerful, the idea of founding a monarchy
seemed to take more consistency in his mind. Yet it may be inferred
from a passage in Plutarch (<cite>Brut.</cite> 7), that he was not decided on the
question of an hereditary succession when he died.</p>

<p class='c014'><a href='#r325'>325</a>. <cite><span lang="la">Ad Att.</span></cite> xiv. 1.—A very curious statue of Brutus is to be seen at
the Campana Museum. The artist has not tried to idealize his model,
and seems to have aimed at nothing but a vulgar exactness; but we
can very well recognize in it the real Brutus. We can trace in that
low forehead and the heavy bones of the face a narrow mind and an
obstinate will. The face has a feverish and sickly look; it is at once
young and old, as is the case with those who have never really been
young. Above all we perceive in it a strange sadness, that of a man
overwhelmed by the weight of a great and fateful destiny. In the fine
bust of Brutus preserved in the Museum of the Capitol, the face is
fuller and handsomer. The sweetness and sadness remain; the sickly
look has disappeared. The features exactly resemble those on the
famous medal struck during Brutus’ last years, and which bears on the
reverse a Phrygian cap between two daggers, with the threatening
legend, <i><span lang="la">Idus Martiae</span></i>. Michael Angelo commenced a bust of Brutus,
of which the admirable rough model may be seen at the Uffizi in
Florence. It was not a fancy study, and we see that he had made use
of ancient portraits while idealizing them.</p>

taking Brutus on his weak side. His descent from him who expelled
the kings was much contested. The more it was regarded as doubtful
the more anxious he was to prove it. To say to him: “No, you are
not Brutus,” was to put on him the necessity or the temptation of
proving his origin by his actions.</p>

Guillaume et Delbet. Paris, 1863. Didot. As the Galatians spoke
Greek and understood Latin ill, the official text was put in the place of
honour, in the temple itself, and the translation was placed outside
where every one might read it, in order to bring the narrative of
Augustus within their reach. But the exterior of the temple has not
been any more respected than the interior. The Turks have fixed their
houses against the walls, carelessly driving their beams into the marble,
and using the solid masonry as a support for their brick and mud party-walls.
All the skill of M. Perrot and his companion M. Guillaume was
required to penetrate into these inhospitable houses. When they had
entered they met with still greater difficulties. It was necessary to
demolish the walls, take away the beams and support the roofs in order
to reach the ancient wall. This was but little. The wall was hammered
and cracked, blackened by dirt and smoke. How could the inscription
that covered it be deciphered? It was necessary to remain for weeks
in dark and foul rooms, or on the straw of a loft, working by candlelight,
throwing the light in every direction on the surface of the marble,
and thus gradually winning each letter by extraordinary efforts of
courage and perseverance. This painful labour was rewarded by complete
success. Of nineteen columns of Greek text, the English traveller
Hamilton had copied five completely and fragments of another; M.
Perrot brings back twelve entirely new ones. One only, the ninth,
could not be read; it was behind a thick party-wall that it was found
impossible to pull down. These twelve columns, although they have
suffered much from the ravages of time, fill up in great part the lacunae
of the Latin text. They make us acquainted with entire paragraphs of
which no traces remain in the original; and even in passages where the
Latin was better preserved they rectify at almost every step mistakes
that had been made in the interpretation of the text. M. Egger, in
his <cite><span lang="fr">Examen des historiens d’Auguste</span></cite>, p. 412 <em>et seq.</em>, has carefully and
critically studied the inscription of Ancyra. M. Mommsen, with the
help of M. Perrot’s copy, is preparing a learned work on this inscription,
after which, no doubt, nothing will remain to be done. (M.
Mommsen’s work, that was announced in the first edition of this book,
has since appeared under the title: <cite><span lang="la">Res gestae divi Augusti ex monumentis
Ancurano et Apolloniensi</span></cite>.)</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f383'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r383'>383</a>. The figure cannot be read either in the Latin or Greek.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f384'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r384'>384</a>. The figure cannot be read. The great number of gladiators who
fought, and no doubt perished in these bloody <i><span lang="fr">fêtes</span></i> will be noticed.
Seneca, to show how far men can become indifferent to death, relates
that, under Tiberius, a gladiator complained of the rarity of these grand
massacres; and alluding to the time of Augustus said: “That was a
good time! <i><span lang="la">Quam bella aetas periit!</span></i>”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f385'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r385'>385</a>. There is some probability, according to a passage of Suetonius (<cite>Aug.</cite>
52), that what the Greek text of the inscription calls absolute authority
<span lang="grc">αὐτεξουσιὸς ἀρχὴ</span> was the dictatorship.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f386'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r386'>386</a>. I have only summed up here a very curious chapter of Dio Cassius
(<cite>Hist. Rom.</cite> liii. 17). We see there clearly how the Roman constitution,
in which the separation of powers was a guarantee for liberty,
became, by the sole fact of their concentration, a formidable engine of
despotism.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f387'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r387'>387</a>. The Ancyra inscription gives most precise information on the
subject of this increase. In 725 Augustus took the census for the first
time after an interruption of forty-one years: 4,063,000 citizens were
counted in this return. Twenty-one years later, in 746, the numbers
returned amounted to 4,233,000. In 767, the year of Augustus’ death,
there were 4,937,000. If, to the figures that Augustus gives, we add
the number of women and children who were not comprised in the
Roman census, we shall see that in the last twenty years of his reign
the increase had reached an average of very nearly 16 per cent. This
is exactly the figure to which the increase of population in France rose,
after the Revolution, from 1800 to 1825; that is, like political circumstances
produced like results. It might be thought, indeed, that this
increase of population under Augustus was due to the introduction of
foreigners into the city. But we know, from Suetonius, that Augustus,
contrary to the example and principles of Caesar, was very chary of
the title of Roman citizen.</p>
